late early united states engaged cold war geopolitical rivalry soviet union
october soviet union launched sputnik first artificial satellite
unexpected success stoked fears imaginations around world
demonstrated soviet union capability deliver nuclear weapons distances challenged american claims military economic technological superiority
launch precipitated sputnik crisis triggered space race
president john kennedy believed national interest united states superior nations perception american power least important actuality
therefore intolerable soviet union advanced field space exploration
determined united states compete sought challenge maximized chances winning
soviet union better booster rockets meant kennedy needed choose goal beyond capacity existing generation rocketry one us soviet union would starting position equality something spectacular even could justified military economic scientific grounds
consulting experts advisors chose project land man moon return earth
project already name project apollo
early crucial decision adoption lunar orbit rendezvous specialized spacecraft would land lunar surface

indeed possible delivery would slip february march
following original seven step plan would meant delaying subsequent missions endangering program goal lunar landing end
george low manager apollo spacecraft program office proposed solution august keep program track despite lm delay
since next csm designated csm would ready three months lm csm mission could flown december
instead repeating mission flight apollo csm could sent way moon possibility entering lunar orbit returning earth
new mission would also allow nasa test lunar landing procedures would otherwise wait apollo scheduled mission
also meant medium earth orbit mission could dispensed
net result mission delayed plan lunar landing mid could remain timeline
august low discussed idea gilruth flight director chris kraft director flight crew operations donald slayton
flew marshall space flight center msfc huntsville alabama met ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel phillips rocco petrone wernher von braun
kraft considered proposal feasible flight control standpoint debus petrone agreed next saturn could made ready december von braun confident pogo oscillation problems afflicted apollo fixed
almost every senior manager nasa agreed new mission citing confidence hardware personnel along potential circumlunar flight providing significant morale boost
person needed convincing james webb nasa administrator
backed full support agency webb authorized mission
apollo officially changed mission prime lunar orbit mission
change mission apollo slayton asked mcdivitt still wanted fly
mcdivitt turned crew spent great deal time preparing test lm still wanted
slayton decided swap prime backup crews dand emissions
swap also meant swap spacecraft requiring borman crew use csm mcdivitt crew would use csm since cm could made ready december
david scott happy giving cm testing closely supervised cm although two almost identical anders less enthusiastic lmp flight lm

apollo suffered several major problems april flight including severe pogo oscillation first stage two second stage engine failures third stage failed reignite orbit
without assurances problems rectified nasa administrators could justify risking crewed mission additional uncrewed test flights proved saturn ready
teams msfc went work problems
primary concern pogo oscillation would hamper engine performance could exert significant forces crew
task force contractors nasa agency representatives msfc researchers concluded engines vibrated frequency similar frequency spacecraft vibrated causing resonance effect induced oscillations rocket
system used helium gas absorb vibrations installed
pad equal importance failure three engines flight
researchers quickly determined leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured exposed vacuum causing loss fuel pressure engine two
automatic shutoff attempted close liquid hydrogen valve shut engine two accidentally shut engine three liquid oxygen due miswired connection
result engine three failed within one second engine two shutdown
investigation revealed problem third stage engine faulty igniter line
team modified igniter lines fuel conduits hoping avoid similar problems future launches
teams tested solutions august msfc
saturn stage ic equipped shock absorbing devices demonstrate team solution problem pogo oscillation saturn stage ii retrofitted modified fuel lines demonstrate resistance leaks ruptures vacuum conditions
nasa administrators convinced problems solved gave approval crewed mission using
apollo spacecraft placed top rocket september rocket made slow journey launch pad october

despite difficulty resting cramped noisy spacecraft borman able sleep two orbits awakening periodically ask questions status
borman awoke fully however started hear fellow crew members make mistakes

borman realized everyone extremely tired good night sleep three days
ordered anders lovell get sleep rest flight plan regarding observing moon scrubbed
anders initially protested saying fine borman would swayed
anders finally agreed condition borman would set camera continue take automatic pictures moon
borman also remembered second television broadcast planned many people expected watching wanted crew alert
next two orbits anders lovell slept borman sat helm
