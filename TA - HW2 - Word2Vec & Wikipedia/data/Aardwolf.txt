aardwolf proteles cristata insectivorous mammal native east southern africa
name means earth wolf afrikaans dutch
also called maanhaar jackal afrikaans mane jackal gÄ«b nama people ant hyena termite eating hyena civet hyena based habit secreting substances anal gland characteristic shared african civet
aardwolf family hyena
unlike many relatives order carnivora aardwolf hunt large animals
eats insects larvae mainly termites one aardwolf lap many termites single night using long sticky tongue aardwolves tongue adapted tough enough withstand strong bite termites
aardwolf lives shrublands eastern southern africa open lands covered stunted trees shrubs
nocturnal resting burrows day emerging night seek food
aardwolf generally classified hyena family hyaenidae though formerly placed family protelidae
early scientists felt merely mimicking striped hyena subsequently led creation protelidae
recent studies suggested aardwolf probably broke away rest hyena family early early still unclear fossil record genetic studies disagree million years
aardwolf surviving species subfamily protelinae
disagreement whether species monotypic
divided subspecies
cristatus southern africa
septentrionalis east africa
generic name proteles comes two words greek origin protos teleos combined means complete front based fact five toes front feet four rear
specific name cristatus comes latin means provided comb relating mane
detail head taken cincinnati zoo skeleton aardwolf displayed museum osteology
aardwolf resembles thin striped hyena slender muzzle black vertical stripes coat yellowish fur long distinct mane midline neck back
also one two diagonal stripes fore hind quarters along several stripes legs
mane raised confrontations make aardwolf appear larger
missing throat spot others family
lower leg knee black tail bushy black tip
aardwolf skull aardwolf long excluding bushy tail long stands tall shoulders
adult aardwolf weighs approximately sometimes reaching
aardwolves south continent tend smaller eastern version around
front feet five toes unlike four toed hyena
teeth skull similar hyenas though smaller cheek teeth specialised eating insects
still canines unlike hyenas teeth used primarily fighting defense
ears large similar striped hyena
aardwolf ages normally lose teeth though little impact feeding habits due softness insects eats
aardwolves live open dry plains bushland avoiding mountainous areas
due specific food requirements found regions termites family hodotermitidae occur
termites family depend dead withered grass populous heavily grazed grasslands savannahs including farmland
year aardwolves spend time shared territories consisting dozen dens occupied six weeks time
two distinct populations one southern africa another east northeast africa
species occur intermediary miombo forests
adult pair along recent offspring occupies territory
san antonio zoo aardwolves shy nocturnal sleeping burrows day
occasion winter become diurnal feeders
happens coldest periods stay night conserve heat
often mistaken solitary animals
fact live monogamous pairs young
territory infringed upon chase intruder border
intruder caught rarely happens fight occur accompanied soft clucking hoarse barking type roar
majority incursions occur mating season occur twice per week
food scarce stringent territorial system may abandoned many three pairs may occupy single territory
territory marked sexes developed anal glands extrude black substance smeared rocks grass stalks long streaks
aardwolves also scent glands forefoot penile pad
often mark near termite mounds within territory every minutes
patrolling territorial boundaries marking frequency increases drastically every
rate individual may mark marks per hour upwards per night
aardwolf pair may dens numerous feces middens within territory
deposit excreta middens dig small hole cover sand
dens usually abandoned aardvark springhare porcupine dens occasion crevices rocks
also dig dens enlarge dens started springhares
typically use one two dens time rotating dens every six months
summer may rest outside den night sleep underground heat day
aardwolves fast runners particularly adept fighting predators
therefore threatened aardwolf may attempt mislead foe doubling back tracks
confronted may raise mane attempt appear menacing
also emits foul smelling liquid anal glands
feeding aardwolf feeds primarily termites specifically trinervitermes
genus termites different species throughout aardwolf range
east africa eat trinervitermes bettonianus central africa eat trinervitermes rhodesiensis southern africa eat
trinervoides
technique consists licking ground opposed aardvark digs mound
locate food sound also scent secreted soldier termites
aardwolf may consume termites per night using long sticky tongue
destroy termite mound consume entire colony thus ensuring termites rebuild provide continuous supply food
often memorize location nests return every months
certain seasonal events onset rainy season cold midwinter primary termites become scarce need foods becomes pronounced
times southern aardwolf seek hodotermes mossambicus type harvester termite active afternoon explains diurnal behavior winter
eastern aardwolf rainy season subsists termites genera odontotermes macrotermes
also known feed insects larvae eggs sources say occasionally small mammals birds constitute small percentage total diet
unlike hyenas aardwolves scavenge kill larger animals
contrary popular myths aardwolves eat carrion seen eating hunched dead carcass actually eating larvae beetles
also contrary sources like meat unless finely ground cooked
adult aardwolf formerly assumed forage small groups recent research shown primarily solitary foragers necessary scarcity insect prey
primary source trinervitermes forages small dense patches
foraging aardwolf cover per hour translates per summer night per winter night
breeding breeding season varies depending location normally takes place autumn spring
south africa breeding occurs early july
breeding season unpaired male aardwolves search territory well others female mate
dominant males also mate females less dominant neighboring aardwolves result conflict rival males
dominant males even go step breeding season approaches make increasingly greater greater incursions onto weaker males territories
female comes oestrus add pasting tricks inside territories sometimes rivals territories
females also given opportunity mate dominant male increases chances dominant male guarding cubs
copulation lasts hours
gestation lasts days producing two five cubs often two three rainy season november december termites active
born eyes open initially helpless weigh around
first six eight weeks spent den parents
male may spend six hours night watching cubs mother looking food
three months begin supervised foraging four months normally independent though often share den mother next breeding season
time next set cubs born older cubs moved
aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity one half two years age
aardwolf seen decreasing numbers relatively widespread throughout eastern africa
common throughout range maintain density per square kilometer food abundant
factors iucn rated aardwolf least concern
areas persecuted mistaken belief prey livestock however actually beneficial farmers eat termites detrimental
areas farmers recognized still killed occasion fur
dogs insecticides also common killers aardwolf
aardwolves rare sights zoos
frankfurt zoo germany home oldest recorded aardwolf captivity years months
