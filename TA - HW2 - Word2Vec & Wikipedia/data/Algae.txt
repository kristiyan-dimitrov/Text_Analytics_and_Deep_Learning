algae singular alga informal term large diverse group photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms
polyphyletic grouping including species multiple distinct clades
included organisms range unicellular microalgae chlorella diatoms multicellular forms giant kelp large brown alga may grow length
aquatic autotrophic lack many distinct cell tissue types stomata xylem phloem found land plants
largest complex marine algae called seaweeds complex freshwater forms charophyta division green algae includes example spirogyra stoneworts
definition algae generally accepted
one definition algae chlorophyll primary photosynthetic pigment lack sterile covering cells around reproductive cells
although cyanobacteria often referred blue green algae authorities exclude prokaryotes definition algae
algae constitute polyphyletic group since include common ancestor although plastids seem single origin cyanobacteria acquired different ways
green algae examples algae primary chloroplasts derived endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
diatoms brown algae examples algae secondary chloroplasts derived endosymbiotic red alga
algae exhibit wide range reproductive strategies simple asexual cell division complex forms sexual reproduction
algae lack various structures characterize land plants phyllids leaf like structures bryophytes rhizoids nonvascular plants roots leaves organs found tracheophytes vascular plants
phototrophic although mixotrophic deriving energy photosynthesis uptake organic carbon either osmotrophy myzotrophy phagotrophy
unicellular species green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates algae become heterotrophs also called colorless apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely external energy sources limited photosynthetic apparatus
heterotrophic organisms apicomplexans also derived cells whose ancestors possessed plastids traditionally considered algae
algae photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived cyanobacteria produce oxygen product photosynthesis unlike photosynthetic bacteria purple green sulfur bacteria

chloroplasts contain circular dna like cyanobacteria interpreted representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
however exact origin chloroplasts different among separate lineages algae reflecting acquisition different endosymbiotic events
table describes composition three major groups algae
lineage relationships shown figure upper right
many groups contain members longer photosynthetic
retain plastids chloroplasts others lost plastids entirely
phylogeny based plastid genealogy supergroup affiliation members endosymbiont summary primoplantae archaeplastida chlorophyta rhodophyta glaucophyta cyanobacteria algae primary chloroplasts
chloroplasts surrounded two membranes probably developed single endosymbiotic event
chloroplasts red algae chlorophylls often phycobilins green algae chloroplasts chlorophyll without phycobilins
land plants pigmented similarly green algae probably developed thus chlorophyta sister taxon plants sometimes chlorophyta charophyta land plants grouped together viridiplantae
excavata rhizaria euglenids green algae groups green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls
chloroplasts surrounded four three membranes respectively probably retained ingested green algae
belong phylum cercozoa contain small nucleomorph relict algae nucleus
euglenids belong phylum euglenozoa live primarily fresh water chloroplasts three membranes
endosymbiotic green algae may acquired myzocytosis rather phagocytosis
chromista alveolata heterokonts haptophyta cryptomonads dinoflagellates red algae groups chloroplasts containing chlorophylls phycobilins
shape varies plant plant may discoid plate like reticulate cup shaped spiral ribbon shaped
one pyrenoids preserve protein starch

symbioses algae supply photosynthates organic substances host organism providing protection algal cells
host organism derives energy requirements algae
examples lichens rock lichens ireland lichens defined international association lichenology association fungus photosynthetic symbiont resulting stable vegetative body specific structure
fungi mycobionts mainly ascomycota basidiomycota
nature occur separate lichens
unknown began associate
one mycobiont associates phycobiont species rarely two green algae except alternatively mycobiont may associate species cyanobacteria hence photobiont accurate term
photobiont may associated many different mycobionts may live independently accordingly lichens named classified fungal species
association termed morphogenesis lichen form capabilities possessed symbiont species alone experimentally isolated
photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes mycobiont
trentepohlia example common green alga genus worldwide grow lichenised
lichen thus share habitat often similar appearance specialized species algae aerophytes growing exposed surfaces tree trunks rocks sometimes discoloring
coral reefs floridian coral reef coral reefs accumulated calcareous exoskeletons marine invertebrates order scleractinia stony corals
animals metabolize sugar oxygen obtain energy cell building processes including secretion exoskeleton water carbon dioxide byproducts
dinoflagellates algal protists often endosymbionts cells coral forming marine invertebrates accelerate host cell metabolism generating sugar oxygen immediately available photosynthesis using incident light carbon dioxide produced host
reef building stony corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae genus symbiodinium healthy condition
loss symbiodinium host known coral bleaching condition leads deterioration reef
sea sponges endosymbiontic green algae live close surface sponges example breadcrumb sponges halichondria panicea
alga thus protected predators sponge provided oxygen sugars account sponge growth species
rhodophyta chlorophyta three main algal divisions lifecycles show considerable variation complexity
general asexual phase exists seaweed cells diploid sexual phase cells haploid followed fusion male female gametes
asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases less variation possible
commonly sexual reproduction unicellular colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact fuse form zygote
ensure successful mating development release gametes highly synchronized regulated pheromones may play key role processes
sexual reproduction allows variation provides benefit efficient recombinational repair dna damages meiosis key stage sexual cycle
however sexual reproduction costly asexual reproduction
meiosis shown occur many different species algae
