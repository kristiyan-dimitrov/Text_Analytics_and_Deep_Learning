adobe buildings similar appearance cob rammed earth buildings
adobe among earliest building materials used throughout world
adobe bricks rectangular prisms small enough quickly air dry individually without cracking

dry climates adobe structures extremely durable account oldest existing buildings world
adobe buildings offer significant advantages due greater thermal mass known particularly susceptible earthquake damage reinforced
cases adobe structures widely damaged earthquakes include guatemala earthquake bam earthquake chile earthquake
buildings made sun dried earth common throughout world middle east western asia north africa west africa south america southwestern north america spain eastern europe
adobe use indigenous peoples americas southwestern united states mesoamerica andes several thousand years

modern english usage term adobe come include style architecture popular desert climates north america especially new mexico regardless construction method
adobe style santa fe new mexico adobe brick composite material made earth mixed water organic material straw dung
soil composition typically contains sand silt clay
straw useful binding brick together allowing brick dry evenly thereby preventing cracking due uneven shrinkage rates brick
dung offers advantage
desirable soil texture producing mud adobe clay silt fine sand
another source quotes clay remainder sand coarser particles cobbles deleterious effect
modern adobe stabilized either emulsified asphalt portland cement weight
half clay content expansive clays remainder non expansive illite kaolinite
much expansive clay results uneven drying brick resulting cracking much kaolinite make weak brick
typically soils southwest united states construction widely used adequate composition

struts projecting wall serve decoration well supports scaffolding maintenance
adobe walls load bearing
carry weight foundation rather another structure hence adobe must sufficient compressive strength
united states building codes call minimum compressive strength lbf newton mm adobe block
adobe construction designed avoid lateral structural loads would cause bending loads
building codes require building sustain lateral acceleration earthquake load
acceleration cause lateral loads walls resulting shear bending inducing tensile stresses
withstand loads codes typically call tensile modulus rupture strength least lbf newton mm finished block
addition inexpensive material small resource cost adobe serve significant heat reservoir due thermal properties inherent massive walls typical adobe construction
climates typified hot days cool nights high thermal mass adobe mediates high low temperatures day moderating temperature living space
massive walls require large relatively long input heat sun radiation surrounding air convection warm interior
sun sets temperature drops warm wall continue transfer heat interior several hours due time lag effect
thus well planned adobe wall appropriate thickness effective controlling inside temperature wide daily fluctuations typical desert climates factor contributed longevity building material
thermodynamic material properties significant variation literature
experiments suggest standard consideration conductivity adequate material main thermodynamic property inertia conclude experimental tests performed longer period time usual preferably changing thermal jumps

oldest methods building adobe americas holes ground used forms later wooden forms used make individual bricks introduced spanish
adobe bricks adobe bricks near construction site milyanfan kyrgyzstan bricks made adobe usually made pressing mud mixture open timber frame
north america brick typically size
mixture molded frame removed initial setting
drying hours bricks turned edge finish drying
slow drying shade reduces cracking
mixture without straw used make mortar often plaster interior exterior walls
cultures used lime based cement plaster protect rain damage
depending form mixture pressed adobe encompass nearly shape size provided drying even mixture includes reinforcement larger bricks
reinforcement include manure straw cement rebar wooden posts
straw cement manure added standard adobe mixture produce stronger crack resistant brick
test done soil content first
sample soil mixed clear container water creating almost completely saturated liquid
container shaken vigorously one minute
allowed settle day soil settled layers
heavier particles settle first sand silt fine clay organic matter stay suspension days
water cleared percentages various particles determined
fifty percent sand percent clay yield strong bricks
cooperative state research education extension service new mexico state university recommends mix clay less sand never silt

modern construction codes call use reinforcing steel footing stem wall
adobe bricks laid course
adobe walls usually never rise two stories load bearing adobe low structural strength
creating window door openings lintel placed top opening support bricks
atop last courses brick bond beams made heavy wood beams modern reinforced concrete laid provide horizontal bearing plate roof beams redistribute lateral earthquake loads shear walls able carry forces
protect interior exterior adobe walls finishes mud plaster whitewash stucco applied
protect adobe wall water damage need reapplied periodically
alternatively walls finished nontraditional plasters provide longer protection
bricks made stabilized adobe generally need protection plasters
adobe roof traditional adobe roof constructed using mixture soil clay water sand organic materials
mixture formed pressed wood forms producing rows dried earth bricks would laid across support structure wood plastered place adobe
depending materials available roof may assembled using wood metal beams create framework begin layering adobe bricks
depending thickness adobe bricks framework preformed using steel framing layering metal fencing wiring framework allow even load masses adobe spread across metal fencing like cob allowed air dry accordingly
method demonstrated adobe blend heavily impregnated cement allow even drying prevent cracking
traditional flat adobe roofs functional dry climates exposed snow loads
heaviest wooden beams called vigas lie atop wall
across vigas lie smaller members called latillas upon brush laid
finally adobe layer applied
construct flat adobe roof beams wood laid span building ends attached tops walls
vigas latillas brush laid adobe bricks placed
adobe roof often laid bricks slightly larger width ensure greater expanse covered placing bricks onto roof
following individual brick layer adobe mortar recommended least thick make certain ample strength brick edges also provide relative moisture barrier rain
roof design evolved around american southwest
three inches adobe mud applied top latillas inches dry adobe dirt applied roof
dirt contoured low slope downspout aka canal
moisture applied roof clay particles expanded create waterproof membrane
year necessary pull weeds roof slope dirt needed
depending materials adobe roofs inherently fire proof
construction chimney greatly influence construction roof supports creating extra need care choosing materials
builders make adobe chimney stacking simple adobe bricks similar fashion surrounding walls
uniform building code ubc adopted united states
