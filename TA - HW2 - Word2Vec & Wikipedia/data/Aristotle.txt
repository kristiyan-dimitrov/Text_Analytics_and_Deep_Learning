mieza macedonia greece general details aristotle life well established
biographies written ancient times often speculative historians agree salient points
aristotle whose name means best purpose ancient greek born bc stagira chalcidice km miles east modern day thessaloniki
father nicomachus personal physician king amyntas macedon
aristotle parents died thirteen proxenus atarneus became guardian

period athens bc aristotle believed composed many works
wrote many dialogues fragments survived
works survived treatise form part intended widespread publication generally thought lecture aids students
important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics soul poetics
aristotle studied made significant contributions logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance theatre
near end life alexander aristotle became estranged alexander relationship persia persians

logic prior analytics aristotle credited earliest study formal logic conception dominant form western logic th century advances mathematical logic
kant stated critique pure reason aristotle logic reached completion
organon one aristotle types syllogism words terms equations men mortal
greeks men greeks mortal
ps ms px today call aristotelian logic types syllogism methods logical argument aristotle would labelled analytics
term logic reserved mean dialectics
aristotle work probably original form likely edited students later lecturers
logical works aristotle compiled set six books called organon around bc andronicus rhodes others among followers
books categories interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics sophistical refutations plato left aristotle raphael fresco school athens
aristotle holds nicomachean ethics gestures earth representing view immanent realism whilst plato gestures heavens indicating theory forms holds timaeus
order books teachings composed certain list derived analysis aristotle writings
goes basics analysis simple terms categories analysis propositions elementary relations interpretation study complex forms namely syllogisms analytics dialectics topics sophistical refutations
first three treatises form core logical theory stricto sensu grammar language logic correct rules reasoning
rhetoric conventionally included states relies topics
metaphysics word metaphysics appears coined first century ad editor assembled various small selections aristotle works treatise know name metaphysics
aristotle called first philosophy distinguished mathematics natural science physics contemplative theoretikē philosophy theological studies divine
wrote metaphysics substance aristotle examines concepts substance ousia essence ti ên einai metaphysics book vii concludes particular substance combination matter form philosophical theory called hylomorphism
book viii distinguishes matter substance substratum stuff composed
example matter house bricks stones timbers etc whatever constitutes potential house form substance actual house namely covering bodies chattels differentia let us define something house
formula gives components account matter formula gives differentia account form
immanent realism plato forms exist universals like ideal form apple
aristotle matter form belong individual thing hylomorphism
like teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims universal
aristotle ontology places universal katholou particulars kath hekaston things world whereas plato universal separately existing form actual things imitate
aristotle form still phenomena based instantiated particular substance
plato argued things universal form could either property relation things
look apple example see apple also analyse form apple
distinction particular apple universal form apple
moreover place apple next book speak book apple next
plato argued universal forms part particular things
example possible particular good existence good still proper universal form
aristotle disagreed plato point arguing universals instantiated period time universals unattached existing things
addition aristotle disagreed plato location universals
plato spoke world forms place universal forms subsist aristotle maintained universals exist within thing universal predicated
according aristotle form apple exists within apple rather world forms
potentiality actuality regard change kinesis causes defines physics generation corruption distinguishes coming growth diminution change quantity locomotion change space alteration change quality
potential made actual learning
coming change nothing persists resultant property
particular change introduces concept potentiality dynamis actuality entelecheia association matter form
referring potentiality thing capable acted upon conditions right prevented something else
example seed plant soil potentially dynamei plant prevented something become plant
potentially beings either act poiein acted upon paschein either innate learned
example eyes possess potentiality sight innate acted upon capability playing flute possessed learning exercise acting
actuality fulfilment end potentiality
end telos principle every change sake end exists potentiality therefore actuality end
referring previous example could say actuality plant one activities plants
summary matter used make house potentiality house activity building form final house actualities also final cause end
aristotle proceeds concludes actuality prior potentiality formula time substantiality
definition particular substance matter form aristotle tries solve problem unity beings example makes man one
since according plato two ideas animal biped man unity
however according aristotle potential matter actual one form one
epistemology aristotle immanent realism means epistemology based study things exist happen world rises knowledge universal whereas plato epistemology begins knowledge universal forms ideas descends knowledge particular imitations
aristotle uses induction examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies deduction priori principles
aristotle natural philosophy spans wide range natural phenomena including covered physics biology natural sciences
aristotle terminology natural philosophy branch philosophy examining phenomena natural world includes fields would regarded today physics biology natural sciences
aristotle work encompassed virtually facets intellectual inquiry
aristotle makes philosophy broad sense coextensive reasoning also would describe science
note however use term science carries different meaning covered term scientific method
aristotle science dianoia either practical poetical theoretical metaphysics
practical science includes ethics politics poetical science means study fine arts including poetry theoretical science covers physics mathematics metaphysics
physics four classical elements fire air water earth empedocles aristotle illustrated burning log
log releases four elements destroyed
five elements generation corruption aristotle related four elements proposed earlier empedocles earth water air fire two four sensible qualities hot cold wet dry
empedoclean scheme matter made four elements differing proportions
aristotle scheme added heavenly aether divine substance heavenly spheres stars planets
aristotle elements element motion modern stateof matter earth solid water liquid air gas fire plasma aether divinesubstance circular heavens motion aristotle describes two kinds motion violent unnatural motion thrown stone physics natural motion falling object heavens
violent motion soon agent stops causing motion stops also words natural state object rest since aristotle address friction
understanding observed aristotle stated heavy objects ground say require force make move objects pushed greater force move faster
would imply equation incorrect modern physics
natural motion depends element concerned aether naturally moves circle around heavens empedoclean elements move vertically like fire observed like earth towards natural resting places
physics states objects fall speed proportional weight inversely proportional density fluid immersed
correct approximation objects earth gravitational field moving air water
physics aristotle effectively states quantitative law speed falling body proportional say constant weight inversely proportional density fluid falling aristotle implies vacuum speed fall would become infinite concludes apparent absurdity vacuum possible
opinions varied whether aristotle intended state quantitative laws
henri carteron held extreme view aristotle concept force basically qualitative authors reject
archimedes corrected aristotle theory bodies move towards natural resting places metal boats float displace enough water floating depends archimedes scheme mass volume object aristotle thought elementary composition
aristotle writings motion remained influential early modern period
john philoponus middle ages galileo said shown experiment aristotle claim heavier object falls faster lighter object incorrect
contrary opinion given carlo rovelli argues aristotle physics motion correct within domain validity objects earth gravitational field immersed fluid air
system heavy bodies steady fall indeed travel faster light ones whether friction ignored fall slowly denser medium
newton forced motion corresponds aristotle violent motion external agent aristotle assumption agent effect stops immediately stops acting ball leaves thrower hand awkward consequences suppose surrounding fluid helps push ball along make continue rise even though hand longer acting resulting medieval theory impetus
four causes aristotle argued analogy woodwork thing takes form four causes case table wood used material cause design formal cause tools techniques used efficient cause decorative practical purpose final cause
aristotle suggested reason anything coming attributed four different types simultaneously active factors
term aitia traditionally translated cause always refer temporal sequence might better translated explanation traditional rendering employed
material cause describes material something composed
thus material cause table wood
action
mean one domino knocks another domino
formal cause form arrangement matter
tells us thing thing determined definition form pattern essence whole synthesis archetype
embraces account causes terms fundamental principles general laws whole macrostructure cause parts relationship known whole part causation
plainly put formal cause idea mind sculptor brings sculpture
simple example formal cause mental image idea allows artist architect engineer create drawing
efficient cause primary source change consideration proceeds
identifies makes made causes change changed suggests sorts agents nonliving living acting sources change movement rest
representing current understanding causality relation cause effect covers modern definitions cause either agent agency particular events states affairs
case two dominoes first knocked causes second also fall
case animals agency combination develops egg body functions
final cause telos purpose reason thing exists done including purposeful instrumental actions activities
final cause purpose function something supposed serve
covers modern ideas motivating causes volition
case living things implies adaptation particular way life
optics aristotle describes experiments optics using camera obscura problems book
apparatus consisted dark chamber small aperture let light
saw whatever shape made hole sun image always remained circular
also noted increasing distance aperture image surface magnified image
chance spontaneity according aristotle spontaneity chance causes things distinguishable types cause simple necessity
chance incidental cause lies realm accidental things spontaneous
also specific kind chance aristotle names luck applies people moral choices
astronomy astronomy aristotle refuted democritus claim milky way made stars shaded earth sun rays pointing correctly size sun greater earth distance stars earth many times greater sun sun shines stars earth screens none
aristotle noted ground level aeolian islands changed volcanic eruption
geology aristotle one first people record geological observations
stated geological change slow observed one person lifetime
geologist charles lyell noted aristotle described change including lakes dried deserts become watered rivers giving examples growth nile delta since time homer upheaving one aeolian islands previous volcanic eruption
biology hectocotyl arm octopus bottom left
empirical research aristotle first person study biology systematically biology forms large part writings
spent two years observing describing zoology lesbos surrounding seas including particular pyrrha lagoon centre lesbos
data history animals generation animals movement animals parts animals assembled observations statements given people specialized knowledge beekeepers fishermen less accurate accounts provided travellers overseas
apparent emphasis animals rather plants historical accident works botany lost two books plants pupil theophrastus survived
aristotle reports sea life visible observation lesbos catches fishermen
describes catfish electric ray frogfish detail well cephalopods octopus paper nautilus
description hectocotyl arm cephalopods used sexual reproduction widely disbelieved th century
gives accurate descriptions four chambered fore stomachs ruminants ovoviviparous embryological development hound shark
notes animal structure well matched function among birds heron lives marshes soft mud lives catching fish long neck long legs sharp spear like beak whereas ducks swim short legs webbed feet
darwin noted sorts differences similar kinds animal unlike aristotle used data come theory evolution
aristotle writings seem modern readers close implying evolution aristotle aware new mutations hybridizations could occur saw rare accidents
aristotle accidents like heat waves winter must considered distinct natural causes
thus critical empedocles materialist theory survival fittest origin living things organs ridiculed idea accidents could lead orderly results
put views modern terms nowhere says different species common ancestor one kind change another kinds become extinct
scientific style aristotle inferred growth laws observations animals including brood size decreases body mass whereas gestation period increases
correct predictions least mammals data shown mouse elephant
aristotle experiments modern sense
used ancient greek term pepeiramenoi mean observations investigative procedures like dissection
generation animals finds fertilized hen egg suitable stage opens see embryo heart beating inside
instead practiced different style science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common whole groups animals inferring possible causal explanations
style common modern biology large amounts data become available new field genomics
result certainty experimental science sets testable hypotheses constructs narrative explanation observed
sense aristotle biology scientific
data collected documented aristotle inferred quite number rules relating life history features live bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals studied
among correct predictions following
brood size decreases adult body mass elephant fewer young usually one per brood mouse
lifespan increases gestation period also body mass elephants live longer mice longer period gestation heavier
final example fecundity decreases lifespan long lived kinds like elephants fewer young total short lived kinds like mice
classification living things aristotle recorded embryo dogfish attached cord kind placenta yolk sac like higher animal formed exception linear scale highest lowest
aristotle distinguished species animals arranging history animals graded scale perfection scala naturae man top
system eleven grades animal highest potential lowest expressed form birth highest gave live birth hot wet creatures lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs
animals came plants turn minerals
see also grouped modern zoologist would call vertebrates hotter animals blood colder invertebrates animals without blood
blood divided live bearing mammals egg laying birds reptiles fish
without blood insects crustacea non shelled cephalopods shelled hard shelled molluscs bivalves gastropods
recognised animals exactly fit linear scale noted various exceptions sharks placenta like tetrapods
modern biologist explanation available aristotle convergent evolution
believed purposive final causes guided natural processes teleological view justified observed data expression formal design
aristotle scala naturae highest lowest group examples given aristotle blood legs souls rational sensitive vegetative qualities man man blood legs live bearing tetrapods cat hare blood legs cetaceans dolphin whale blood none birds bee eater nightjar blood legs except eggs egg laying tetrapods chameleon crocodile blood legs except scales eggs snakes water snake ottoman viper blood none except scales eggs egg laying fishes sea bass parrotfish blood none including eggs among egg laying fishes placental selachians shark skate blood none placenta like tetrapods crustaceans shrimp crab without many legs except shell cephalopods squid octopus without tentacles hard shelled animals cockle trumpet snail without none mineral shell larva bearing insects ant cicada without legs spontaneously generating sponges worms without none earth plants fig without none minerals iron without none none psychology soul structure souls plants animals humans making humans unique three types soul
aristotle psychology given treatise soul peri psychēs posits three kinds soul psyches vegetative soul sensitive soul rational soul
humans rational soul
human soul incorporates powers kinds like vegetative soul grow nourish like sensitive soul experience sensations move locally
unique part human rational soul ability receive forms things compare using nous intellect logos reason
aristotle soul form living
beings composites form matter form living beings endows specific living beings
ability initiate movement case plants growth chemical transformations aristotle considers types movement
contrast earlier philosophers accordance egyptians placed rational soul heart rather brain
notable aristotle division sensation thought generally differed concepts previous philosophers exception alcmaeon
memory according aristotle soul memory ability hold perceived experience mind distinguish internal appearance occurrence past
words memory mental picture phantasm recovered
aristotle believed impression left semi fluid bodily organ undergoes several changes order make memory
memory occurs stimuli sights sounds complex nervous system cannot receive impressions
changes involved operations sensation aristotelian common sense thinking
aristotle uses term memory actual retaining experience impression develop sensation intellectual anxiety comes impression formed particular time processing specific contents
memory past prediction future sensation present
retrieval impressions cannot performed suddenly
transitional channel needed located past experiences previous experience present experience
aristotle believes people receive kinds sense perceptions perceive impressions people continually weaving together new impressions experiences
search impressions people search memory
within memory one experience offered instead specific memory person reject experience find looking
recollection occurs one retrieved experience naturally follows another
chain images needed one memory stimulate next
people recall experiences stimulate certain previous experiences reach one needed
recollection thus self directed activity retrieving information stored memory impression
humans remember impressions intellectual activity numbers words
animals perception time retrieve memories past observations
remembering involves perception things remembered time passed
senses perception memory dreams action aristotle psychology
impressions stored sensorium heart linked laws association similarity contrast contiguity
aristotle believed chain thought ends recollection certain impressions connected systematically relationships similarity contrast contiguity described laws association
aristotle believed past experiences hidden within mind
force operates awaken hidden material bring actual experience
according aristotle association power innate mental state operates upon unexpressed remains former experiences allowing rise recalled
dreams aristotle describes sleep sleep wakefulness
sleep takes place result overuse senses digestion vital body
person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness
since person cannot sense sleep desire result sensation
however senses able work sleep albeit differently unless weary
dreams involve actually sensing stimulus
dreams sensation still involved altered manner
aristotle explains person stares moving stimulus waves body water look away next thing look appears wavelike motion
person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves impression
body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions previously perceived stimuli ignored
however sleep impressions made throughout day noticed new distracting sensory experiences
dreams result lasting impressions
since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual waking experience
sleep person altered state mind
aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus
example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere overtaken feelings
since person sleeping suggestible state unable make judgements become easily deceived appears dreams like infatuated person
leads person believe dream real even dreams absurd nature
de anima iii aristotle ascribes ability create store recall images absence perception faculty imagination phantasia
one component aristotle theory dreams disagrees previously held beliefs
claimed dreams foretelling sent divine
aristotle reasoned instances dreams resemble future events simply coincidences
aristotle claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience
person image appear moment waking see something dark considered dream awake occurred
secondly sensory experience perceived person asleep qualify part dream
example person sleeping door shuts dream hear door shut sensory experience part dream
lastly images dreams must result lasting impressions waking sensory experiences
aristotle practical philosophy covers areas ethics politics economics rhetoric
virtues accompanying vices little virtuous mean much humbleness high mindedness vainglory lack purpose right ambition ambition spiritlessness good temper irascibility rudeness civility obsequiousness cowardice courage rashness insensibility self control intemperance sarcasm sincerity boastfulness boorishness wit buffoonery shamelessness modesty shyness callousness resentment spitefulness pettiness generosity vulgarity meanness liberality wastefulness war theory aristotelian war theory well regarded present day especially view warfare justified enslave natural slaves
aristotelian philosophy abolition considers natural slavery would undermine civic freedom
pursuit freedom inseparable pursuing mastery deserve slaves
according cambridge companion aristotle politics targets aggressive warfare non greeks noting aristotle view poets say proper greeks rule non greeks
aristotle generally favourable opinion war extolling chance virtue writing leisure accompanies peace tends make people arrogant
war avoid becoming enslaved others justified self defense
writes war compels people temperate however order war must chosen sake peace exception wars aggression discussed
ethics aristotle considered ethics practical rather theoretical study one aimed becoming good good rather knowing sake
wrote several treatises ethics including notably nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught virtue proper function ergon thing
eye good eye much see proper function eye sight
aristotle reasoned humans must function specific humans function must activity psuchē soul accordance reason logos
aristotle identified optimum activity virtuous mean accompanying vices excess deficiency soul aim human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated happiness sometimes well
potential ever happy way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated moral ethical virtue excellence
aristotle taught achieve virtuous potentially happy character requires first stage fortune habituated deliberately teachers experience leading later stage one consciously chooses best things
best people come live life way practical wisdom phronesis intellect nous develop towards highest possible human virtue wisdom accomplished theoretical speculative thinker words philosopher
politics addition works ethics address individual aristotle addressed city work titled politics
aristotle considered city natural community
moreover considered city prior importance family turn prior individual whole must necessity prior part
famously stated man nature political animal argued humanity defining factor among others animal kingdom rationality
aristotle conceived politics like organism rather like machine collection parts none exist without others
aristotle conception city organic considered one first conceive city manner
aristotle classifications political constitutions common modern understanding political community modern state quite different aristotle understanding
although aware existence potential larger empires natural community according aristotle city polis functions political community partnership koinōnia
aim city avoid injustice economic stability rather allow least citizens possibility live good life perform beautiful acts political partnership must regarded therefore sake noble actions sake living together
distinguished modern approaches beginning social contract theory according individuals leave state nature fear violent death inconveniences
protrepticus character aristotle states economics aristotle made substantial contributions economic thought especially thought middle ages
politics aristotle addresses city property trade
response criticisms private property lionel robbins view anticipated later proponents private property among philosophers economists related overall utility social arrangements
aristotle believed although communal arrangements may seem beneficial society although private property often blamed social strife evils fact come human nature
politics aristotle offers one earliest accounts origin money
money came use people became dependent one another importing needed exporting surplus
sake convenience people agreed deal something intrinsically useful easily applicable iron silver
aristotle discussions retail interest major influence economic thought middle ages
low opinion retail believing contrary using money procure things one needs managing household retail trade seeks make profit
thus uses goods means end rather end unto
believed retail trade way unnatural
similarly aristotle considered making profit interest unnatural makes gain money use
aristotle gave summary function money perhaps remarkably precocious time
wrote impossible determine value every good count number goods worth necessity arises single universal standard measurement
money thus allows association different goods makes commensurable
goes state money also useful future exchange making sort security
want thing shall able get want
rhetoric poetics blind oedipus commending children gods bénigne gagneraux
poetics aristotle uses tragedy oedipus tyrannus sophocles example perfect tragedy structured generally good protagonist starts play prosperous loses everything hamartia fault
aristotle rhetoric proposes speaker use three basic kinds appeals persuade audience ethos appeal speaker character pathos appeal audience emotion logos appeal logical reasoning

aristotle states mimesis natural instinct humanity separates humans animals human artistry follows pattern nature
aristotle believed mimetic arts possesses stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures achievement purposes
example music imitates media rhythm harmony whereas dance imitates rhythm alone poetry language
forms also differ object imitation
comedy instance dramatic imitation men worse average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better average
lastly forms differ manner imitation narrative character change change drama drama
believed aristotle poetics originally comprised two books one comedy one tragedy portion focuses tragedy survived
aristotle taught tragedy composed six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle lyric poetry
characters tragedy merely means driving story plot characters chief focus tragedy
tragedy imitation action arousing pity fear meant effect catharsis emotions
aristotle concludes poetics discussion either superior epic tragic mimesis
suggests tragedy possesses attributes epic possibly possesses additional attributes spectacle music unified achieves aim mimesis shorter scope considered superior epic
