alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces
stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise greater boiling points alkanes
two determinants strength van der waals forces number electrons surrounding molecule increases alkane molecular weight surface area molecule standard conditions ch alkanes gaseous liquids solids
boiling point alkanes primarily determined weight surprise boiling point almost linear relationship size molecular weight molecule
rule thumb boiling point rises carbon added chain rule applies homologous series
straight chain alkane boiling point higher branched chain alkane due greater surface area contact thus greater van der waals forces adjacent molecules
example compare isobutane methylpropane butane butane boil dimethylbutane dimethylbutane boil respectively
latter case two molecules dimethylbutane lock better cross shaped dimethylbutane hence greater van der waals forces
hand cycloalkanes tend higher boiling points linear counterparts due locked conformations molecules give plane intermolecular contact
melting points melting points alkanes follow similar trend boiling points reason outlined
things equal larger molecule higher melting point

solids rigid fixed structure liquids
rigid structure requires energy break
thus better put together solid structures require energy break apart
alkanes seen graph blue line
odd numbered alkanes lower trend melting points even numbered alkanes
even numbered alkanes pack well solid phase forming well organized structure requires energy break apart
odd numbered alkanes pack less well looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy break apart

conductivity solubility alkanes conduct electricity way substantially polarized electric field
reason form hydrogen bonds insoluble polar solvents water
since hydrogen bonds individual water molecules aligned away alkane molecule coexistence alkane water leads increase molecular order reduction entropy
significant bonding water molecules alkane molecules second law thermodynamics suggests reduction entropy minimized minimizing contact alkane water alkanes said hydrophobic repel water
solubility nonpolar solvents relatively high property called lipophilicity
