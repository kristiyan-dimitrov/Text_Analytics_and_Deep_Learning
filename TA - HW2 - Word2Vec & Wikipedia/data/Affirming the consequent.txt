affirming consequent sometimes called converse error fallacy converse confusion necessity sufficiency formal fallacy taking true conditional statement lamp broken room would dark invalidly inferring converse room dark lamp broken even though converse may true
arises consequent room would dark one possible antecedents example lamp plugged lamp working order switched
converse errors common everyday thinking communication result among causes communication issues misconceptions logic failure consider causes
opposite statement denying consequent valid form argument
affirming consequent action taking true statement invalidly concluding converse
name affirming consequent derives using consequent conclude antecedent
illogic summarized formally alternatively
root cause logic error sometimes failure realize possible condition may condition
may follow another condition well
affirming consequent also result experience many statements true converses
equivalent statements
possible infer condition
example statements august birthday birthday august equivalent true consequences statement august birthday abbreviated form
using one statement conclude example affirming consequent people may misapply approach
example one way demonstrate invalidity argument form counterexample true premises obviously false conclusion
example bill gates owns fort knox bill gates rich
bill gates rich
therefore bill gates owns fort knox
owning fort knox way rich
number ways rich exist
however one affirm certainty someone rich non person fort knox non
contrapositive first statement must true original statement true
example another useful obviously fallacious example one require familiarity bill gates fort knox animal dog four legs
cat four legs
therefore cat dog
immediately intuitive number antecedents animal deer animal elephant animal moose etc
give rise consequent four legs preposterous suppose four legs must imply animal dog nothing else
useful teaching example since people immediately recognize conclusion reached must wrong intuitively cat cannot dog method reached must therefore fallacious
example arguments form sometimes seem superficially convincing following example brian thrown top eiffel tower would dead
brian dead
therefore brian thrown top eiffel tower
thrown top eiffel tower cause death since exist numerous different causes death
affirming consequent commonly used rationalization thus appears coping mechanism people
example catch chaplain interrogated supposedly washington irving irving washington blocking large portions soldiers letters home
colonel found letter chaplain name signed
read though
colonel persevered sarcastically
author signed name
name
wrote

case chaplain signs name chaplain name written
chaplain name may written necessarily write colonel falsely concludes
list fallacies abductive reasoning appeal consequences confusion inverse denying antecedent eliza effect fallacy single cause fallacy undistributed middle inference best explanation modus ponens modus tollens post hoc ergo propter hoc necessity sufficiency
