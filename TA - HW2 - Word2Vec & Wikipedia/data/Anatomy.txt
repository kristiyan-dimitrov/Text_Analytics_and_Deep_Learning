animals bodies differentiated separate tissues animals also known eumetazoans
internal digestive chamber one two openings gametes produced multicellular sex organs zygotes include blastula stage embryonic development
metazoans include sponges cells
unlike plant cells animal cells neither cell wall chloroplasts
vacuoles present number much smaller plant cell
body tissues composed numerous types cell including found muscles nerves skin
typically cell membrane formed phospholipids cytoplasm nucleus
different cells animal derived embryonic germ layers
simpler invertebrates formed two germ layers ectoderm endoderm called diploblastic developed animals whose structures organs formed three germ layers called triploblastic
triploblastic animal tissues organs derived three germ layers embryo ectoderm mesoderm endoderm
animal tissues grouped four basic types connective epithelial muscle nervous tissue
hyaline cartilage high magnification stain connective tissue connective tissues fibrous made cells scattered among inorganic material called extracellular matrix
connective tissue gives shape organs holds place
main types loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage bone
extracellular matrix contains proteins chief abundant collagen
collagen plays major part organizing maintaining tissues
matrix modified form skeleton support protect body
exoskeleton thickened rigid cuticle stiffened mineralization crustaceans cross linking proteins insects
endoskeleton internal present developed animals well many less developed
epithelium gastric mucosa low magnification stain epithelial tissue composed closely packed cells bound cell adhesion molecules little intercellular space
epithelial cells squamous flat cuboidal columnar rest basal lamina upper layer basement membrane lower layer reticular lamina lying next connective tissue extracellular matrix secreted epithelial cells
many different types epithelium modified suit particular function
respiratory tract type ciliated epithelial lining small intestine microvilli epithelial lining large intestine intestinal villi
skin consists outer layer keratinized stratified squamous epithelium covers exterior vertebrate body
keratinocytes make cells skin
epithelial cells external surface body typically secrete extracellular matrix form cuticle
simple animals may coat glycoproteins
advanced animals many glands formed epithelial cells
muscle tissue cross section skeletal muscle small nerve high magnification stain muscle cells myocytes form active contractile tissue body
muscle tissue functions produce force cause motion either locomotion movement within internal organs
muscle formed contractile filaments separated three main types smooth muscle skeletal muscle cardiac muscle
smooth muscle striations examined microscopically
contracts slowly maintains contractibility wide range stretch lengths
found organs sea anemone tentacles body wall sea cucumbers
skeletal muscle contracts rapidly limited range extension
found movement appendages jaws
obliquely striated muscle intermediate two
filaments staggered type muscle found earthworms extend slowly make rapid contractions
higher animals striated muscles occur bundles attached bone provide movement often arranged antagonistic sets
smooth muscle found walls uterus bladder intestines stomach oesophagus respiratory airways blood vessels
cardiac muscle found heart allowing contract pump blood round body
nervous tissue nervous tissue composed many nerve cells known neurons transmit information
slow moving radially symmetrical marine animals ctenophores cnidarians including sea anemones jellyfish nerves form nerve net animals organized longitudinally bundles
simple animals receptor neurons body wall cause local reaction stimulus
complex animals specialized receptor cells chemoreceptors photoreceptors found groups send messages along neural networks parts organism
neurons connected together ganglia
higher animals specialized receptors basis sense organs central nervous system brain spinal cord peripheral nervous system
latter consists sensory nerves transmit information sense organs motor nerves influence target organs
peripheral nervous system divided somatic nervous system conveys sensation controls voluntary muscle autonomic nervous system involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain glands internal organs including stomach

spinal cord protected vertebral column notochord tract
nervous tissue derived ectoderm connective tissues derived mesoderm gut derived endoderm
posterior end tail continues spinal cord vertebrae gut
mouth found anterior end animal anus base tail
defining characteristic vertebrate vertebral column formed development segmented series vertebrae
vertebrates notochord becomes nucleus pulposus intervertebral discs

jawed vertebrates typified paired appendages fins legs may secondarily lost
limbs vertebrates considered homologous underlying skeletal structure inherited last common ancestor
