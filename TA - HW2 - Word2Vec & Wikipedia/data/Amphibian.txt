amphibians ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates class amphibia
living amphibians belong group lissamphibia
inhabit wide variety habitats species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal freshwater aquatic ecosystems
thus amphibians typically start larvae living water species developed behavioural adaptations bypass
young generally undergo metamorphosis larva gills adult air breathing form lungs
amphibians use skin secondary respiratory surface small terrestrial salamanders frogs lack lungs rely entirely skin
superficially similar lizards along mammals birds reptiles amniotes require water bodies breed
complex reproductive needs permeable skins amphibians often ecological indicators recent decades dramatic decline amphibian populations many species around globe

first major groups amphibians developed devonian period around million years ago lobe finned fish similar modern coelacanth lungfish
ancient lobe finned fish evolved multi jointed leg like fins digits enabled crawl along sea bottom
fish developed primitive lungs help breathe air stagnant pools devonian swamps low oxygen
could also use strong fins hoist water onto dry land circumstances required
eventually bony fins would evolve limbs would become ancestors tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds mammals
despite able crawl land many prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent time water
started develop lungs still breathed predominantly gills
many examples species showing transitional features discovered
ichthyostega one first primitive amphibians nostrils efficient lungs
four sturdy limbs neck tail fins skull similar lobe finned fish eusthenopteron
amphibians evolved adaptations allowed stay water longer periods
lungs improved skeletons became heavier stronger better able support weight bodies land
developed hands feet five digits skin became capable retaining body fluids resisting desiccation
fish hyomandibula bone hyoid region behind gills diminished size became stapes amphibian ear adaptation necessary hearing dry land
affinity amphibians teleost fish multi folded structure teeth paired supra occipital bones back head neither features found elsewhere animal kingdom
permian lepospondyl diplocaulus largely aquatic end devonian period million years ago seas rivers lakes teeming life land realm early plants devoid vertebrates though ichthyostega may sometimes hauled water
thought may propelled forelimbs dragging hindquarters similar manner used elephant seal
early carboniferous million years ago climate became wet warm
extensive swamps developed mosses ferns horsetails calamites
air breathing arthropods evolved invaded land provided food carnivorous amphibians began adapt terrestrial environment
tetrapods land amphibians top food chain occupying ecological position currently held crocodile

development amniotic egg prevents developing embryo drying enabled reptiles reproduce land led dominance period followed
carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way reptiles amphibians devastated permian triassic extinction event
triassic period million years ago reptiles continued compete amphibians leading reduction amphibians size importance biosphere
according fossil record lissamphibia includes modern amphibians surviving lineage may branched extinct groups temnospondyli lepospondyli period late carboniferous early triassic
relative scarcity fossil evidence precludes precise dating recent molecular study based multilocus sequence typing suggests late carboniferous early permian origin extant amphibians
temnospondyl eryops sturdy limbs support body land origins evolutionary relationships three main groups amphibians matter debate
molecular phylogeny based rdna analysis suggests salamanders caecilians closely related frogs
also appears divergence three groups took place paleozoic early mesozoic around million years ago breakup supercontinent pangaea soon divergence lobe finned fish
briefness period swiftness radiation took place would help account relative scarcity primitive amphibian fossils
large gaps fossil record discovery gerobatrachus hottoni early permian texas provided missing link many characteristics modern frogs
molecular analysis suggests frog salamander divergence took place considerably earlier evidence indicates
newer research indicates common ancestor lissamphibians lived million years ago stereospondyls closest relatives caecilians
evolved lunged fish amphibians make certain adaptations living land including need develop new means locomotion

developed behaviours suitable reproduction terrestrial environment
skins exposed harmful ultraviolet rays previously absorbed water
skin changed become protective prevent excessive water loss
superclass tetrapoda divided four classes vertebrate animals four limbs
reptiles birds mammals amniotes eggs either laid carried female surrounded several membranes impervious
lacking membranes amphibians require water bodies reproduction although species developed various strategies protecting bypassing vulnerable aquatic larval stage
found sea exception one two frogs live brackish water mangrove swamps anderson salamander meanwhile occurs brackish salt water lakes
land amphibians restricted moist habitats need keep skin damp
modern amphibians simplified anatomy compared ancestors due paedomorphosis caused two evolutionary trends miniaturization unusually large genome result slower growth development rate compared vertebrates
another reason size associated rapid metamorphosis seems evolved ancestors lissamphibia known lines development much gradual
remodeling feeding apparatus means eat metamorphosis metamorphosis go faster smaller individual happens early stage larvae still small
largest species salamanders go metamorphosis
amphibians lay eggs land often go whole metamorphosis inside egg
anamniotic terrestrial egg less cm diameter due diffusion problems size puts limit amount posthatching growth

explosive breeders hand found temporary pools appear dry regions rainfall
frogs typically fossorial species emerge heavy rains congregate breeding site
attracted calling first male find suitable place perhaps pool forms place rainy season
assembled frogs may call unison frenzied activity ensues males scrambling mate usually smaller number females
sexual selection studied red back salamander direct competition males win attention females salamanders newts elaborate courtship displays keep female attention long enough get interested choosing mate

although many frog species females larger males case species males actively involved territorial defence
specific adaptations enlarged teeth biting spines chest arms thumbs
red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends territory intruders
salamanders defence territory involves adopting aggressive posture necessary attacking intruder
may involve snapping chasing sometimes biting occasionally causing loss tail
behaviour red back salamanders plethodon cinereus much studied
marked individuals later recaptured within metre yard original daytime retreat log rock
similar proportion moved experimentally distance found way back home base
salamanders left odour marks around territories averaged size sometimes inhabited male female pair
deterred intrusion others delineated boundaries neighbouring areas
much behaviour seemed stereotyped involve actual contact individuals
aggressive posture involved raising body ground glaring opponent often turned away submissively
intruder persisted biting lunge usually launched either tail region naso labial grooves
damage either areas reduce fitness rival either need regenerate tissue impairs ability detect food
frogs male territorial behaviour often observed breeding locations calling announcement ownership part resource advertisement call potential mates
general deeper voice represents heavier powerful individual may sufficient prevent intrusion smaller males
much energy used vocalization takes toll territory holder may displaced fitter rival tires
tendency males tolerate holders neighbouring territories vigorously attacking unknown intruders
holders territories home advantage usually come better encounter two similar sized frogs
threats insufficient chest chest tussles may take place
fighting methods include pushing shoving deflating opponent vocal sac seizing head jumping back biting chasing splashing ducking water
cane toad rhinella marina poison glands behind eyes amphibians soft bodies thin skins lack claws defensive armour spines
nevertheless evolved various defence mechanisms keep alive
