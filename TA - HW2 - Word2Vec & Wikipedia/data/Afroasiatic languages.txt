bonny sands finds proposal savà tosco convincing namely ongota east cushitic language nilo saharan substratum
words would appear ongota people spoke nilo saharan language shifted speaking cushitic language retained characteristics earlier nilo saharan language
beja sometimes listed separate branch afroasiatic often included cushitic branch substantial degree internal diversity

classification history th century hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh tiaret algeria first link two branches afroasiatic together perceived relationship berber semitic
knew semitic study arabic hebrew aramaic
course th century europeans also began suggesting relationships
theodor benfey suggested language family consisting semitic berber cushitic calling latter ethiopic
year
newman suggested relationship semitic hausa would long remain topic dispute uncertainty
friedrich müller named traditional hamito semitic family grundriss der outline linguistics defined consisting semitic group plus hamitic group containing egyptian berber cushitic excluded chadic group
egyptologist karl richard lepsius restricted hamitic non semitic languages africa characterized grammatical gender system
hamitic language group proposed unite various mainly north african languages including ancient egyptian language berber languages cushitic languages beja language chadic languages
unlike müller lepsius considered hausa nama part hamitic group
classifications relied part non linguistic anthropological racial arguments
authors used skin color mode subsistence characteristics native speakers part arguments particular languages grouped together
distribution afroasiatic hamito semitic languages africa carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten languages hamites expanded lepsius model adding fula maasai bari nandi sandawe hadza languages hamitic group
meinhof model widely supported
meinhof system classification hamitic languages based belief speakers hamitic became largely coterminous cattle herding peoples essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different superior negroes africa
however case called nilo hamitic languages concept introduced based typological feature gender fallacious theory language mixture
meinhof although earlier work scholars lepsius johnston substantiated languages would later dub nilo hamitic fact nilotic languages numerous similarities vocabulary nilotic languages
leo reinisch already proposed linking cushitic chadic urging distant affinity egyptian semitic
however suggestion found little acceptance
marcel cohen rejected idea distinct hamitic subgroup included hausa chadic language comparative hamito semitic vocabulary
finally joseph greenberg work led widespread rejection hamitic language category linguists
greenberg refuted meinhof linguistic theories rejected use racial social evidence
dismissing notion separate nilo hamitic language category particular greenberg returning view widely held half century earlier
consequently rejoined meinhof called nilo hamitic languages appropriate nilotic siblings
also added sub classified chadic languages proposed new name afroasiatic family
almost scholars accepted classification new continued consensus
greenberg model fully developed book languages africa reassigned meinhof additions hamitic language families notably nilo saharan
following isaac schapera rejecting meinhof classified khoekhoe language member khoisan languages grouping since proven inaccurate excessively motivated presence click sounds
khoisan also added tanzanian hadza sandawe though view discredited linguists working languages consider linguistic isolates
despite greenberg classification remains starting point modern work many languages spoken africa hamitic category extension nilo hamitic part
since three traditional branches hamitic languages berber cushitic egyptian shown form exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit separate afroasiatic languages linguists longer use term sense
branches instead regarded independent subgroup larger afroasiatic family
harold fleming proposed previously known western cushitic independent branch afroasiatic suggesting new name omotic
proposal name met widespread acceptance
based typological differences cushitic languages robert hetzron proposed beja removed cushitic thus forming independent branch afroasiatic
scholars however reject proposal continue group beja sole member northern branch within cushitic
glottolog accept inclusion even unity omotic established ongota unclassified kujarge
therefore splits following groups small families south omotic mao dizoid gonga gimojan north omotic apart preceding ongota kujarge

however christopher ehret harold fleming joseph greenberg agree omotic branch split rest first
otherwise paul newman groups berber chadic egyptian semitic questioning inclusion omotic afroasiatic
rolf theil concurs exclusion omotic otherwise address structure family
harold fleming divides non omotic afroasiatic erythraean three groups cushitic semitic chadic berber egyptian
later added semitic beja chadic berber egyptian tentatively proposed ongota new third branch erythraean
thus divided afroasiatic two major branches omotic erythraean erythraean consisting three sub branches cushitic chadic berber egyptian semitic beja ongota
like harold fleming christopher ehret divides afroasiatic two branches omotic erythrean
