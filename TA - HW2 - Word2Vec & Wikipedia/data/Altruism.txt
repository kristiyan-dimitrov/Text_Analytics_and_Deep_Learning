giving alms poor often considered altruistic action
altruism principle moral practice concern happiness human beings animals resulting quality life material spiritual
traditional virtue many cultures core aspect various religious traditions secular worldviews though concept others toward concern directed vary among cultures religions
extreme case altruism may become synonym selflessness opposite selfishness
word altruism coined french philosopher auguste comte french altruisme antonym egoism
derived italian altrui turn derived latin alteri meaning people somebody else
altruism biological observations field populations day organisms individual performing action cost pleasure quality life time probability survival reproduction benefits either directly indirectly another individual without expectation reciprocity compensation action
steinberg suggests definition altruism clinical setting intentional voluntary actions aim enhance welfare another person absence quid pro quo external rewards
one sense opposite altruism spite spiteful action harms another self benefit
altruism distinguished feelings loyalty whilst latter predicated upon social relationships altruism consider relationships
much debate exists whether true altruism possible human psychology
theory psychological egoism suggests act sharing helping sacrificing described truly altruistic actor may receive intrinsic reward form personal gratification
validity argument depends whether intrinsic rewards qualify benefits
term altruism may also refer ethical doctrine claims individuals morally obliged benefit others
used sense usually contrasted egoism claims individuals morally obligated serve first
effective altruism use evidence reason determine effective ways benefit others
concept long history philosophical ethical thought
term originally coined th century founding sociologist philosopher science auguste comte become major topic psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists ethologists
whilst ideas altruism one field affect fields different methods focuses fields always lead different perspectives altruism
simple terms altruism caring welfare people acting help
anthropology marcel mauss book gift contains passage called note alms
note describes evolution notion alms extension altruism notion sacrifice
writes alms fruits moral notion gift fortune one hand notion sacrifice
generosity obligation nemesis avenges poor gods superabundance happiness wealth certain people rid
ancient morality gift become principle justice
gods spirits accept share wealth happiness offered hitherto destroyed useless sacrifices serve poor children
evolutionary explanations giving alms beggar children science ethology study animal behaviour generally study social evolution altruism refers behaviour individual increases fitness another individual decreasing fitness actor
evolutionary psychology may applied wide range human behaviors charity emergency aid help coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production public goods
theories apparently altruistic behavior accelerated need produce theories compatible evolutionary origins
two related strands research altruism emerged traditional evolutionary analyses evolutionary game theory mathematical model analysis behavioural strategies
proposed mechanisms kin selection
animals humans altruistic towards close kin distant kin non kin confirmed numerous studies across many different cultures
even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior
one kinship cue facial resemblance
one study found slightly altering photographs closely resembled faces study participants increased trust participants expressed regarding depicted persons
another cue family name especially rare found increase helpful behavior
another study found cooperative behavior greater number perceived kin group
using kinship terms political speeches increased audience agreement speaker one study
effect especially strong firstborns typically close families
vested interests
people likely suffer friends allies similar social ingroups suffer even disappear
helping group members may therefore eventually benefit altruist
making ingroup membership noticeable increases cooperativeness
extreme self sacrifice towards ingroup may adaptive hostile outgroup threatens kill entire ingroup
reciprocal altruism
see also reciprocity evolution
direct reciprocity
research shows beneficial help others chance reciprocate help
effective tit tat strategy one game theoretic example
many people seem following similar strategy cooperating others cooperate return
one consequence people cooperative likely individuals interact future
people tend less cooperative perceive frequency helpers population lower
tend help less see non cooperativeness others effect tend stronger opposite effect seeing cooperative behaviors
simply changing cooperative framing proposal may increase cooperativeness calling community game instead wall street game
tendency towards reciprocity implies people feel obligated respond someone helps
used charities give small gifts potential donors hoping thereby induce reciprocity
another method announce publicly someone given large donation
tendency reciprocate even generalize people become helpful toward others general helped
hand people avoid even retaliate perceived cooperating
people sometimes mistakenly fail help intended helping may noticed may cause unintended conflicts
may optimal strategy slightly forgiving slightly generous interpretation non cooperation
people likely cooperate task communicate one another first
may due better assessments cooperativeness due exchange promises
cooperative gradually build trust instead asked give extensive help immediately
direct reciprocity cooperation group increased changing focus incentives intra group competition larger scale competitions groups general population
thus giving grades promotions based individual performance relative small local group common may reduce cooperative behaviors group
indirect reciprocity
avoidance poor reciprocators cheaters causes person reputation become important
person good reputation reciprocity higher chance receiving help even persons direct interactions previously
strong reciprocity
form reciprocity individuals seem spend resources cooperating punishing would beneficial predicted several established theories altruism
number theories proposed explanations well criticisms regarding existence
pseudo reciprocity
organism behaves altruistically recipient reciprocate increased chance acting way selfish also byproduct benefits altruist
costly signaling handicap principle
since altruism takes away resources altruist honest signal resource availability abilities needed gather resources
may signal others altruist valuable potential partner
may also signal interactive cooperative intentions since interacting future gain nothing costly signaling
unclear costly signaling indicate long term cooperative personality people increased trust help
costly signaling pointless everyone traits resources cooperative intentions become potentially important signal population increasingly varies characteristics
hunters widely sharing meat seen costly signal ability research found good hunters higher reproductive success adulterous relations even receive hunted meat anyone else
similarly holding large feasts giving large donations seen ways demonstrating one resources
heroic risk taking also interpreted costly signal ability
volunteers assist hurricane victims houston astrodome following hurricane katrina
indirect reciprocity costly signaling depend value reputation tend make similar predictions
one people helping know helping behavior communicated people interact later publicly announced discussed simply observed someone else
documented many studies
effect sensitive subtle cues people helpful stylized eyespots instead logo computer screen
weak reputational cues eyespots may become unimportant stronger cues present may lose effect continued exposure unless reinforced real reputational effects
public displays public weeping dead celebrities participation demonstrations may influenced desire seen altruistic
people know publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money know needed recipient may reputational concerns
women found find altruistic men attractive partners
looking long term partner altruism may preferred trait may indicate also willing share resources children
shown men perform altruistic acts early stages romantic relationship simply presence attractive woman
sexes state kindness preferable trait partner evidence men place less value women women may altruistic presence attractive man
men may even avoid altruistic women short term relationships may expect less success
people may compete social benefit burnished reputation may cause competitive altruism
hand experiments proportion people seem care reputation help even conspicuous
may possibly due reasons psychopathy attractive need seen altruistic
reputational benefits altruism occur future compared immediate costs altruism present
humans organisms generally place less value future costs benefits compared present shorter time horizons others people tend less cooperative
explicit extrinsic rewards punishments found sometimes actually opposite effect behaviors compared intrinsic rewards
may extrinsic top incentives may replace partially whole intrinsic reputational incentives motivating person focus obtaining extrinsic rewards overall may make behaviors less desirable
another effect people would like altruism due personality characteristic rather due overt reputational concerns simply pointing reputational benefits action may actually reduce
may possibly used derogatory tactic altruists especially non cooperators
counterargument good due reputational concerns better good
group selection
controversially argued evolutionary scientists david sloan wilson natural selection act level non kin groups produce adaptations benefit non kin group even adaptions detrimental individual level
thus altruistic persons may circumstances outcompeted less altruistic persons individual level according group selection theory opposite may occur group level groups consisting altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting less altruistic persons
altruism may extend ingroup members may instead prejudice antagonism outgroup members see also group favoritism
group selection theory criticized many evolutionary scientists
homeless new york city explanations imply humans always consciously calculating increase inclusive fitness altruistic acts
instead evolution shaped psychological mechanisms emotions promote altruistic behaviors
every single instance altruistic behavior need always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would selected behaviors average increased inclusive fitness ancestral environment
need imply average altruistic acts beneficial altruist ancestral environment benefits helping right person high would beneficial err side caution usually altruistic even cases benefits
benefits altruist may increased costs reduced altruistic towards certain groups
research found people altruistic kin kin friends strangers attractive unattractive non competitors competitors members ingroups members outgroup
study altruism initial impetus behind george price development price equation mathematical equation used study genetic evolution
interesting example altruism found cellular slime moulds dictyostelium mucoroides
protists live individual amoebae starved point aggregate form multicellular fruiting body cells sacrifice promote survival cells fruiting body
selective investment theory proposes close social bonds associated emotional cognitive neurohormonal mechanisms evolved order facilitate long term high cost altruism closely depending one another survival reproductive success

debate whether humans truly capable psychological altruism
definitions specify self sacrificial nature altruism lack external rewards altruistic behaviors
however altruism ultimately benefits self many cases selflessness altruistic acts brought question
social exchange theory postulates altruism exists benefits self outweigh costs self
daniel batson psychologist examined question argues social exchange theory
identified four major motives ultimately benefit self egoism ultimately benefit person altruism benefit group collectivism uphold moral principle principlism
altruism ultimately serves selfish gains thus differentiated selfless altruism general conclusion empathy induced altruism genuinely selfless
empathy altruism hypothesis basically states psychological altruism exist evoked empathic desire help someone suffering
feelings empathic concern contrasted feelings personal distress compel people reduce unpleasant emotions
people empathic concern help others distress even exposure situation could easily avoided whereas lacking empathic concern avoid helping unless difficult impossible avoid exposure another suffering
helping behavior seen humans two years old toddler capable understanding subtle emotional cues
peace corps trainees swearing volunteers cambodia april psychological research altruism studies often observe altruism demonstrated prosocial behaviors helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy community service
research found people likely help recognize person need feel personal responsibility reducing person distress
research also suggests number bystanders witnessing distress suffering affects likelihood helping bystander effect
greater numbers bystanders decrease individual feelings responsibility
however witness high level empathic concern likely assume personal responsibility entirely regardless number bystanders
many studies observed effects volunteerism form altruism happiness health consistently found strong connection volunteerism current future health well
study older adults volunteered higher life satisfaction live lower depression anxiety somatization
volunteerism helping behavior shown improve mental health physical health longevity well attributable activity social integration encourages
one study examined physical health mothers volunteered year period found belong volunteer organization experienced major illness volunteer experienced one
study adults ages found four year study period people volunteered two organizations lower likelihood dying
controlling prior health status determined volunteerism accounted reduction mortality
merely aware kindness oneself others also associated greater well
study asked participants count act kindness performed one week significantly enhanced subjective happiness
important note research supports idea altruistic acts bring happiness also found work opposite direction happier people also kinder
relationship altruistic behavior happiness bidirectional
studies found generosity increases linearly sad happy affective states
studies also careful note feeling taxed needs others conversely negative effects health happiness
example one study volunteerism found feeling overwhelmed others demands even stronger negative effect mental health helping positive one although positive effects still significant
additionally generous acts make people feel good also important people appreciate kindness receive others
studies suggest gratitude goes hand hand kindness also important well
study relationship happiness various character strengths showed conscious focus gratitude led reductions negative affect increases optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality well
