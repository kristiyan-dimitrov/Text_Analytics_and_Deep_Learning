animation television animation became popular television since television sets started become common developed countries
cartoons mainly programmed children convenient time slots especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday morning cartoons
many classic cartoons found new life small screen end production new animated cartoons started shift theatrical releases tv series
hanna barbera productions especially prolific huge hit series flintstones first prime time animated series scooby doo since belgian co production smurfs
constraints american television programming demand enormous quantity resulted cheaper quicker limited animation methods much formulaic scripts
quality dwindled daring animation surfaced late early hit series simpsons since part renaissance american animation
us animated series also spawned successes internationally many countries produced child oriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion puppetry cel animation
japanese anime tv series became successful internationally since european producers looking affordable cel animators relatively often started co productions japanese studios resulting hit series barbapapa netherlands japan france wickie und die starken männer 小さなバイキング ビッケ vicky viking austria germany japan il était une fois upon time france japan

joy heron featured video creation non trivial animation works longer seconds developed form filmmaking certain unique aspects
traits common live action animated feature length films labor intensity high production costs
important difference film production phase marginal cost one shot higher animated films live action films
relatively easy director ask one take principal photography live action film every take animated film must manually rendered animators although task rendering slightly different takes made less tedious modern computer animation
pointless studio pay salaries dozens animators spend weeks creating visually dazzling five minute scene scene fails effectively advance plot film
thus animation studios starting disney began practice maintaining story departments storyboard artists develop every single scene storyboards handing film animators production team satisfied scenes make sense whole
live action films also storyboarded enjoy latitude depart storyboards real time improvisation
another problem unique animation requirement maintain film consistency start finish even films grown longer teams grown larger
animators like artists necessarily individual styles must subordinate individuality consistent way whatever style employed particular film
since early teams people animators typically created feature length animated films
relatively easy two three artists match styles synchronizing dozens artists difficult
problem usually solved separate group visual development artists develop overall look palette film animation begins
character designers visual development team draw model sheets show character look like different facial expressions posed different positions viewed different angles
traditionally animated projects maquettes often sculpted help animators see characters would look different angles
unlike live action films animated films traditionally developed beyond synopsis stage storyboard format storyboard artists would receive credit writing film
early animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters write screenplays also continuing use story departments screenplays become commonplace animated films late
traditional animation example traditional animation horse animated rotoscoping eadweard muybridge th century photos traditional animation also called cel animation hand drawn animation process used animated films th century
individual frames traditionally animated film photographs drawings first drawn paper
create illusion movement drawing differs slightly one
animators drawings traced photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels filled paints assigned colors tones side opposite line drawings
completed character cels photographed one one painted background rostrum camera onto motion picture film
traditional cel animation process became obsolete beginning st century
today animators drawings backgrounds either scanned drawn directly computer system
various software programs used color drawings simulate camera movement effects
final animated piece output one several delivery media including traditional mm film newer media digital video
look traditional cel animation still preserved character animators work remained essentially past years
animation producers used term tradigital play words traditional digital describe cel animation uses significant computer technology
examples traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states animal farm united kingdom lucky zorba italy illusionist british french
traditionally animated films produced aid computer technology include lion king us prince egypt us akira japan spirited away japan triplets belleville france secret kells irish french belgian
full animation full animation refers process producing high quality traditionally animated films regularly use detailed drawings plausible movement smooth animation
fully animated films made variety styles realistically animated works like produced walt disney studio little mermaid beauty beast aladdin lion king cartoon styles warner bros animation studio
many disney animated features examples full animation non disney works secret nimh us iron giant us nocturna spain
fully animated films animated frames per second combination animation ones twos meaning drawings held one frame two frames
limited animation limited animation involves use less detailed stylized drawings methods movement usually choppy skippy movement animation
limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting fluidity animation
economic technique
pioneered artists american studio united productions america limited animation used method stylized artistic expression gerald mcboing boing us yellow submarine uk certain anime produced japan
primary use however producing cost effective animated content media television work hanna barbera filmation tv animation studios later internet web cartoons
rotoscoping rotoscoping technique patented max fleischer animators trace live action movement frame frame
source film directly copied actors outlines animated drawings lord rings us used stylized expressive manner waking life us scanner darkly us
examples fire ice us heavy metal aku hana
live action animation live action animation technique combining hand drawn characters live action shots live action actors animated shots
one earlier uses koko clown koko drawn live action footage
walt disney ub iwerks created series alice comedies live action girl enters animated world
examples include allegro non troppo italy framed roger rabbit us volere volare italy space jam us osmosis jones us
stop motion animation stop motion animation used describe animation created physically manipulating real world objects photographing one frame film time create illusion movement
many different types stop motion animation usually named medium used create animation
computer software widely available create type animation traditional stop motion animation usually less expensive time consuming produce current computer animation
puppet animation typically involves stop motion puppet figures interacting constructed environment contrast real world interaction model animation
puppets generally armature inside keep still steady constrain motion particular joints
examples include tale fox france nightmare christmas us corpse bride us coraline us films jiří trnka adult animated sketch comedy television series robot chicken us present
puppetoon created using techniques developed george pal puppet animated films typically use different version puppet different frames rather simply manipulating one existing puppet
finnish television commercial clay animation plasticine animation often called claymation however trademarked name uses figures made clay similar malleable material create stop motion animation
figures may armature wire frame inside similar related puppet animation manipulated pose figures
alternatively figures may made entirely clay films bruce bickford clay creatures morph variety different shapes
examples clay animated works include gumby show us mio mao italy morph shorts uk wallace gromit shorts uk jan švankmajer dimensions dialogue czechoslovakia trap door uk
films include wallace gromit curse rabbit chicken run adventures mark twain
strata cut animation strata cut animation commonly form clay animation long bread like loaf clay internally packed tight loaded varying imagery sliced thin sheets animation camera taking frame end loaf cut eventually revealing movement internal images within
cutout animation type stop motion animation produced moving two dimensional pieces material paper cloth
examples include terry gilliam animated sequences monty python flying circus uk fantastic planet france czechoslovakia tale tales russia pilot episode adult television sitcom series sometimes episodes south park us music video live moment verona riots band produced alberto serrano nívola uyá spain
silhouette animation variant cutout animation characters backlit visible silhouettes
examples include adventures prince achmed weimar republic princes et princesses france
model animation refers stop motion animation created interact exist part live action world
intercutting matte effects split screens often employed blend stop motion characters objects live actors settings
examples include work ray harryhausen seen films jason argonauts work willis brien films king kong
go motion variant model animation uses various techniques create motion blur frames film present traditional stop motion
technique invented industrial light magic phil tippett create special effect scenes film empire strikes back
another example dragon named vermithrax film dragonslayer
object animation refers use regular inanimate objects stop motion animation opposed specially created items
graphic animation uses non drawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc
sometimes manipulated frame frame create movement
times graphics remain stationary stop motion camera moved create screen action
brickfilm subgenre object animation involving using lego similar brick toys make animation
recent boost popularity advent video sharing sites youtube availability cheap cameras animation software
pixilation involves use live humans stop motion characters
allows number surreal effects including disappearances reappearances allowing people appear slide across ground effects
examples pixilation include secret adventures tom thumb angry kid shorts academy award winning neighbours norman mclaren
