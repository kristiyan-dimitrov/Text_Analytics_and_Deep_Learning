mathematics statistics arithmetic mean stress first third syllables arithmetic simply mean average context clear sum collection numbers divided count numbers collection
collection often set results experiment observational study frequently set results survey
term arithmetic mean preferred contexts mathematics statistics helps distinguish means geometric mean harmonic mean
addition mathematics statistics arithmetic mean used frequently many diverse fields economics anthropology history used almost every academic field extent
example per capita income arithmetic average income nation population
arithmetic mean often used report central tendencies robust statistic meaning greatly influenced outliers values much larger smaller values
notably skewed distributions distribution income people incomes substantially greater people arithmetic mean may coincide one notion middle robust statistics median may provide better description central tendency
given data set arithmetic mean mean average denoted read bar mean values
arithmetic mean commonly used readily understood measure central tendency data set
statistics term average refers measures central tendency
arithmetic mean set observed data defined equal sum numerical values every observation divided total number observations
symbolically data set consisting values arithmetic mean defined formula explanation summation operator see summation
example consider monthly salary employees firm
arithmetic mean data set statistical population consists every possible observation subset mean population called population mean denoted greek letter
data set statistical sample subset population call statistic resulting calculation sample mean data set denoted
arithmetic mean similarly defined vectors multiple dimension scalar values often referred centroid
generally arithmetic mean convex combination coefficients sum defined convex space vector space
arithmetic mean several properties make useful especially measure central tendency
include numbers mean
since distance given number mean one way interpret property saying numbers left mean balanced numbers right mean
mean single number residuals deviations estimate sum zero
required use single number typical value set known numbers arithmetic mean numbers best sense minimizing sum squared deviations typical value sum
follows sample mean also best single predictor sense lowest root mean squared error
arithmetic mean population numbers desired estimate unbiased arithmetic mean sample drawn population
arithmetic mean may contrasted median
median defined half values larger half smaller median
elements data increase arithmetically placed order median arithmetic average equal
example consider data sample
average median
however consider sample cannot arranged increase arithmetically median arithmetic average differ significantly
case arithmetic average median
general average value vary significantly values sample larger smaller
applications phenomenon many fields
example since median income united states increased slowly arithmetic average income
weighted average weighted average weighted mean average data points count heavily others given weight calculation
example arithmetic mean equivalently
contrast weighted mean first number receives example twice much weight second perhaps assumed appear twice often general population numbers sampled would calculated
weights necessarily sum value one former twice latter
arithmetic mean sometimes called unweighted average equally weighted average interpreted special case weighted average weights equal equal example equal situation numbers averaged
continuous probability distributions comparison two log normal distributions equal median different skewness resulting different means modes numerical property sample data could take value continuous range instead example integers probability number falling range possible values described integrating continuous probability distribution across range even naive probability sample number taking one certain value infinitely many zero
analog weighted average context infinite number possibilities precise value variable range called mean probability distribution
widely encountered probability distribution called normal distribution property measures central tendency including mean also aforementioned median mode three equal
equality hold probability distributions illustrated lognormal distribution
particular care must taken using cyclic data phases angles
naively taking arithmetic mean yields result
incorrect two reasons firstly angle measurements defined additive constant measuring radians
thus one could easily call since one gives different average
secondly situation equivalently geometrically better average value lower dispersion points putative average
general application oversight lead average value artificially moving towards middle numerical range
solution problem use optimization formulation viz define mean central point point one lowest dispersion redefine difference modular distance distance circle modular distance
arithmetic mean often denoted bar example read bar
