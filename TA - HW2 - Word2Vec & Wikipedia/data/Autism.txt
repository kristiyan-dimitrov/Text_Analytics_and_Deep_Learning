globally autism estimated affect million people
number people affected estimated per people worldwide
developed countries children diagnosed asd united states
occurs four five times often males females
number people diagnosed increased dramatically since may partly due changes diagnostic practice
question whether actual rates increased unresolved
autism highly variable disorder whose symptoms first appear infancy childhood generally follows steady course without remission
people autism may severely impaired respects average even superior others
overt symptoms gradually begin age six months become established age two three years tend continue adulthood although often muted form
distinguished characteristic triad symptoms impairments social interaction impairments communication repetitive behavior
aspects atypical eating also common essential diagnosis
individual symptoms autism occur general population appear associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe common traits
social development social deficits distinguish autism related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification developmental disorders
people autism social impairments often lack intuition others many people take granted
noted autistic temple grandin described inability understand social communication neurotypicals people typical neural development leaving feeling like anthropologist mars
unusual social development becomes apparent early childhood
autistic infants show less attention social stimuli smile look others less often respond less name
autistic toddlers differ strikingly social norms example less eye contact turn taking ability use simple movements express pointing things
three five year old children autism less likely exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate respond emotions communicate nonverbally take turns others
however form attachments primary caregivers
children autism display moderately less attachment security neurotypical children although difference disappears children higher mental development less pronounced autistic traits
older children adults asd perform worse tests face emotion recognition although may partly due lower ability define person emotions
children high functioning autism intense frequent loneliness compared non autistic peers despite common belief children autism prefer alone
making maintaining friendships often proves difficult autism
quality friendships number friends predicts lonely feel
functional friendships resulting invitations parties may affect quality life deeply
many anecdotal reports systematic studies aggression violence individuals asd
limited data suggest children intellectual disability autism associated aggression destruction property meltdowns
communication third half individuals autism develop enough natural speech meet daily communication needs
differences communication may present first year life may include delayed onset babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness vocal patterns synchronized caregiver
second third years children autism less frequent less diverse babbling consonants words word combinations gestures less often integrated words
children autism less likely make requests share experiences likely simply repeat others words echolalia reverse pronouns
joint attention seems necessary functional speech deficits joint attention seem distinguish infants asd
example may look pointing hand instead pointed object consistently fail point objects order comment share experience
children autism may difficulty imaginative play developing symbols language
pair studies high functioning children autism aged performed equally well adults better individually matched controls basic language tasks involving vocabulary spelling
autistic groups performed worse controls complex language tasks figurative language comprehension inference
people often sized initially basic language skills studies suggest people speaking autistic individuals likely overestimate audience comprehends
repetitive behavior young boy autism arranged toys row autistic individuals display many forms repetitive restricted behavior repetitive behavior scale revised rbs categorizes follows
stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements hand flapping head rolling body rocking
compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended reduce anxiety individual feels compelled perform repeatedly according rigid rules placing objects specific order checking things hand washing
sameness resistance change example insisting furniture moved refusing interrupted
ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern daily activities unchanging menu dressing ritual
closely associated sameness independent validation suggested combining two factors
restricted interests interests fixations abnormal theme intensity focus preoccupation single television program toy game
self injury behaviors eye poking skin picking hand biting head banging

long presumed common cause genetic cognitive neural levels autism characteristic triad symptoms
however increasing suspicion autism instead complex disorder whose core aspects distinct causes often co occur
deletion duplication inversion chromosome abnormalities implicated autism
autism strong genetic basis although genetics autism complex unclear whether asd explained rare mutations major effects rare multigene interactions common genetic variants

uk national autism plan children recommends weeks first concern completed diagnosis assessment though cases handled quickly practice
although symptoms autism asd begin early childhood sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses help friends family understand help employers make adjustments locations claim disability living allowances benefits
girls often diagnosed later boys
underdiagnosis overdiagnosis problems marginal cases much recent increase number reported asd cases likely due changes diagnostic practices
increasing popularity drug treatment options expansion benefits given providers incentives diagnose asd resulting overdiagnosis children uncertain symptoms
conversely cost screening diagnosis challenge obtaining payment inhibit delay diagnosis
