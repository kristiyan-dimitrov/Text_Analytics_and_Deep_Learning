international atomic time tai french name high precision atomic coordinate time standard based notional passage proper time earth geoid
principal realisation terrestrial time fixed offset epoch
also basis coordinated universal time utc used civil timekeeping earth surface
another leap second added tai exactly seconds ahead utc
seconds results initial difference seconds start plus leap seconds utc since
tai may reported using traditional means specifying days carried non uniform time standards based rotation earth
specifically julian days gregorian calendar used
tai form synchronised universal time beginning two drifted apart ever since due changing motion earth
tai weighted average time kept atomic clocks national laboratories worldwide
majority clocks involved caesium clocks international system units si definition second based caesium
clocks compared using gps signals two way satellite time frequency transfer
due signal averaging tai order magnitude stable best constituent clock
participating institutions broadcast real time frequency signal timecodes estimate tai
time codes usually published form utc differs tai well known integer number seconds
time scales denoted form utc npl utc form npl case identifies national physical laboratory uk
tai form may denoted tai npl
latter confused ta npl denotes independent atomic time scale synchronised tai anything else
clocks different institutions regularly compared
international bureau weights measures bipm france combines measurements retrospectively calculate weighted average forms stable time scale possible
combined time scale published monthly circular canonical tai
time scale expressed form tables differences utc utc equivalent tai tai participating institution
circular also gives tables tai ta various unsynchronised atomic time scales
errors publication may corrected issuing revision faulty circular errata subsequent circular aside published circular tai scale revised
hindsight possible discover errors tai make better estimates true proper time scale
since published circulars definitive better estimates create another version tai instead considered creating better realisation terrestrial time tt
early atomic time scales consisted quartz clocks frequencies calibrated single atomic clock atomic clocks operated continuously
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally using first caesium atomic clock national physical laboratory uk npl
used basis calibrating quartz clocks royal greenwich observatory establish time scale called greenwich atomic ga
united states naval observatory began scale september using atomichron commercial atomic clock followed nbs scale national bureau standards boulder colorado october
international time bureau bih began time scale tm july using local caesium clocks comparisons distant clocks using phase vlf radio signals
bih scale nbs defined epoch beginning procedures used bih evolved name time scale changed ta bih
si second defined terms caesium atom
general conference weights measures international committee weights measures made series decisions designated bipm time scale international atomic time tai
became clear clocks participating tai ticking different rates due gravitational time dilation combined tai scale therefore corresponded average altitudes various clocks
starting julian date january corrections applied output participating clocks tai would correspond proper time mean sea level geoid
clocks average well sea level meant tai slowed one part trillion
former uncorrected time scale continues published name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale
instant gravitational correction started applied serves epoch barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg terrestrial time tt represent three fundamental time scales solar system
three time scales defined read jd january exactly instant
tai henceforth realisation tt equation tt tai tai continued existence tai questioned letter bipm itu stated case redefinition utc without leap seconds cctf would consider discussing possibility suppressing tai would remain parallel continuous utc
utc discontinuous time scale
regularly adjusted leap seconds
adjustments composed segments linear transformations atomic time
beginning december adjustments made regularly fractional leap seconds utc approximated ut
afterwards adjustments made whole seconds approximate ut
compromise arrangement order enable publicly broadcast time scale post linear transformation bih atomic time meant time scale would stable easier synchronize internationally
fact continues approximate ut means tasks navigation require source universal time continue well served public broadcast utc
clock synchronization network time protocol precision time protocol time frequency transfer
