charles morton updated version edward bernard orbis eruditi comparing known alphabets alphabet standardized set basic written symbols graphemes called letters represent phonemes certain spoken languages
writing systems represent language way syllabary character represents syllable instance logographic systems use characters represent words morphemes semantic units
first fully phonemic script proto canaanite script later known phoenician alphabet considered first alphabet ancestor modern alphabets including arabic cyrillic greek hebrew latin possibly brahmic
created semitic speaking workers slaves sinai peninsula proto sinaitic script selecting small number hieroglyphs commonly seen egyptian surroundings describe sounds opposed semantic values canaanite language
peter daniels however distinguishes abugida alphasyllabary set graphemes represent consonantal base letters diacritics modify represent vowels devanagari south asian scripts abjad letters predominantly exclusively represent consonants original phoenician hebrew arabic alphabet set graphemes represent vowels consonants
narrow sense word first true alphabet greek alphabet developed basis earlier phoenician alphabet
dozens alphabets use today popular latin alphabet derived greek many languages modify adding letters formed using diacritical marks
alphabets letters composed lines linear writing also exceptions alphabets used braille
khmer alphabet cambodian longest letters
alphabets usually associated standard ordering letters
makes useful purposes collation specifically allowing words sorted alphabetical order
also means letters used alternative method numbering ordered items contexts numbered lists number placements

phoenician script probably first phonemic script contained two dozen distinct letters making script simple enough common traders learn
another advantage phoenician could used write many different languages since recorded words phonemically
illustration acta eruditorum script spread phoenicians across mediterranean
greece script modified add vowels giving rise ancestor alphabets west
first alphabet vowels independent letter forms separate consonants
greeks chose letters representing sounds exist greek represent vowels
vowels significant greek language syllabical linear script used mycenaean greeks th century bc symbols including vowels

european alphabets especially latin cyrillic adapted many languages asia
arabic also widely used sometimes abjad urdu persian sometimes complete alphabet kurdish uyghur
term alphabet used linguists paleographers wide narrow sense
wider sense alphabet script segmental phoneme level separate glyphs individual sounds larger units syllables words
narrower sense scholars distinguish true alphabets two types segmental script abjads abugidas
three differ way treat vowels abjads letters consonants leave vowels unexpressed abugidas also consonant based indicate vowels diacritics systematic graphic modification consonants
alphabets narrow sense hand consonants vowels written independent letters
earliest known alphabet wider sense wadi el hol script believed abjad successor phoenician ancestor modern alphabets including arabic greek latin via old italic alphabet cyrillic via greek alphabet hebrew via aramaic
examples present day abjads arabic hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic korean hangul abugidas used write tigrinya amharic hindi thai
canadian aboriginal syllabics also abugida rather syllabary name would imply since glyph stands consonant modified rotation represent following vowel
true syllabary consonant vowel combination would represented separate glyph
three types may augmented syllabic glyphs
ugaritic example basically abjad syllabic letters
time vowels indicated
cyrillic basically true alphabet syllabic letters coptic letter
devanagari typically abugida augmented dedicated letters initial vowels though traditions use zero consonant graphic base vowels
boundaries three types segmental scripts always clear cut
example sorani kurdish written arabic script normally abjad
however kurdish writing vowels mandatory full letters used script true alphabet
languages may use semitic abjad mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making abugidas
hand phagspa script mongol empire based closely tibetan abugida vowel marks written preceding consonant rather diacritic marks
although short written indic abugidas one could argue linear arrangement made true alphabet
conversely vowel marks tigrinya abugida amharic abugida ironically original source term abugida completely assimilated consonants modifications longer systematic learned syllabary rather segmental script
even extreme pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic

ge ez script ethiopia eritrea thus primary classification alphabets reflects treat vowels
tonal languages classification based treatment tone though names yet exist distinguish various types
alphabets disregard tone entirely especially carry heavy functional load somali many languages africa americas
scripts tone abjads vowels
commonly tones indicated diacritics way vowels treated abugidas
case vietnamese true alphabet thai abugida
thai tone determined primarily choice consonant diacritics disambiguation
pollard script abugida vowels indicated diacritics placement diacritic relative consonant modified indicate tone
rarely script may separate letters tones case hmong zhuang
scripts regardless whether letters diacritics used common tone marked common vowel marked indic abugidas zhuyin one tones unmarked diacritic indicate lack tone like virama indic
number letters alphabet quite small
book pahlavi script abjad twelve letters one point may even fewer later
today rotokas alphabet twelve letters
hawaiian alphabet sometimes claimed small actually consists letters including ʻokina five long vowels
however hawaiian braille letters
rotokas small alphabet phonemes represent eleven book pahlavi small many letters conflated graphic distinctions lost time diacritics developed compensate arabic another script lost many distinct letter shapes
example comma shaped letter represented
however apparent simplifications perversely make script complicated
later pahlavi papyri half remaining graphic distinctions twelve letters lost script could longer read sequence letters instead word learned whole become logograms egyptian demotic

alphabets often come associated standard ordering letters used purposes collation namely listing words items called alphabetical order
basic ordering latin alphabet derived northwest semitic abgad order well established although languages using alphabet different conventions treatment modified letters french certain combinations letters multigraphs
french considered additional letters purposes collation
however icelandic accented letters considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds sounds represented unaccented counterparts
spanish considered separate letter accented vowels
ch also considered single letters real academia española changed collating order lk lm dictionary ch cg ci tenth congress association spanish language academies changed longer letters
german words starting sch spells german phoneme inserted words initial sca sci incidentally loanwords instead appearing initial sz though single letter contrast several languages albanian dh gj rr th xh zh representing phonemes considered separate single letters would follow letters respectively well hungarian welsh
german words umlaut collated ignoring umlaut contrary turkish adopted graphemes word like tüfek would come tuz dictionary
exception german telephone directory umlauts sorted like ae since names jäger also appear spelling jaeger distinguished spoken language
danish norwegian alphabets end whereas swedish finnish ones conventionally put end
unknown whether earliest alphabets defined sequence
alphabets today hanuno script learned one letter time particular order used collation definite order required
however dozen ugaritic tablets fourteenth century bc preserve alphabet two sequences
one abcde order later used phoenician continued minor changes hebrew greek armenian gothic cyrillic latin hmħlq used southern arabia preserved today ethiopic
orders therefore stable least years
runic used unrelated futhark sequence later simplified
arabic uses sequence although arabic retains traditional abjadi order numbering
brahmic family alphabets used india use unique order based phonology letters arranged according produced mouth
organization used southeast asia tibet korean hangul even japanese kana alphabet
phoenician letter names letter associated word begins sound acrophony continue used varying degrees samaritan aramaic syriac hebrew greek arabic
names abandoned latin instead referred letters adding vowel usually consonant two exceptions borrowed greek alphabet rather etruscan known graeca greek pronounced graeca greek zeta greek discrepancy inherited many european languages term zed forms english american english
time names sometimes shifted added double double french english name american zee
comparing names english french gives clear reflection great vowel shift pronounced today english contemporary french
french names english names derived preserve qualities english vowels great vowel shift
contrast names remain languages short vowels largely unaffected shift
cyrillic originally letters given names based slavic words later abandoned well favor system similar used latin
letters armenian alphabet also distinct letter names
alphabet adopted developed represent given language orthography generally comes providing rules spelling words language
accordance principle alphabets based rules generally map letters alphabet phonemes significant sounds spoken language
perfectly phonemic orthography would consistent one one correspondence letters phonemes writer could predict spelling word given pronunciation speaker would always know pronunciation word given spelling vice versa
however ideal usually achieved practice languages spanish finnish come close others english deviate much larger degree
pronunciation language often evolves independently writing system writing systems borrowed languages designed degree letters alphabet correspond phonemes language varies greatly one language another even within single language
languages may fail achieve one one correspondence letters sounds several ways language may represent given phoneme combination letters rather single letter
two letter combinations called digraphs three letter groups called trigraphs
german uses tetragraphs four letters tsch phoneme borrowed words dsch
kabardian also uses tetragraph one phonemes namely кхъу
two letters representing one sound occur several instances hungarian well instance cs stands tʃ sz zs dzs dʒ
language may represent phoneme two different letters combinations letters
example modern greek may write phoneme six different ways though last rare
language may spell words unpronounced letters exist historical reasons
example spelling thai word beer เบ ยร retains letter final consonant present english word borrowed silences
pronunciation individual words may change according presence surrounding words sentence sandhi
different dialects language may use different phonemes word
language may use different sets symbols different rules distinct sets vocabulary items japanese hiragana katakana syllabaries various rules english spelling words latin greek original germanic vocabulary
national languages sometimes elect address problem dialects simply associating alphabet national standard
national languages like finnish armenian turkish russian serbo croatian serbian croatian bosnian bulgarian regular spelling system nearly one one correspondence letters phonemes
strictly speaking national languages lack word corresponding verb spell meaning split word letters closest match verb meaning split word syllables
similarly italian verb corresponding spell compitare unknown many italians spelling usually trivial italian spelling highly phonemic
standard spanish one tell pronunciation word spelling vice versa certain phonemes represented one way given letter consistently pronounced
french silent letters heavy use nasal vowels elision may seem lack much correspondence spelling pronunciation rules pronunciation though complex actually consistent predictable fair degree accuracy
extreme languages english pronunciations many words simply memorized correspond spelling consistent way
english partly great vowel shift occurred orthography established english acquired large number loanwords different times retaining original spelling varying levels
even english general albeit complex rules predict pronunciation spelling rules successful time rules predict spelling pronunciation higher failure rate
sometimes countries written language undergo spelling reform realign writing contemporary spoken language
range simple spelling changes word forms switching entire writing system turkey switched arabic alphabet latin based turkish alphabet
standard system symbols used linguists represent sounds language independently orthography called international phonetic alphabet
