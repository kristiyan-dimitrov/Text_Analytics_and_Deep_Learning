abacus plural abaci abacuses also called counting frame calculating tool use ancient near east europe china russia centuries adoption written arabic numeral system
exact origin abacus still unknown
abacus essentially consists number rows movable beads objects represent digits
one two numbers set beads manipulated implement operation involving second number addition rarely square cubic root
earliest use rows beads could loose flat surface sliding grooves
later beads made slide rods sort built frame allowing faster manipulation
abacuses still made often bamboo frame beads sliding wires
ancient world particularly introduction positional notation abacuses practical calculating tool
distinctive modern implementations abacus
designs like bead frame consisting beads divided tens used mainly teach arithmetic although remain popular post soviet states tool
designs japanese soroban used practical calculations even involving numbers several digits
particular abacus design usually numerous different methods perform calculations may include four basic operations also square cube roots
methods work non natural numbers numbers
although today calculators computers usually used instead abacuses abacuses still remain common use countries
merchants traders clerks parts eastern europe russia china africa use abacuses still used teach arithmetic children
people unable use calculator visual impairment may use abacus
use word abacus dates ad middle english work borrowed word latin describe sandboard abacus
latin word came ancient greek abax means something without base improperly piece rectangular board plank
alternatively without reference ancient texts etymology suggested means square tablet strewn dust drawing board covered dust use mathematics exact shape latin perhaps reflects genitive form greek word abakos
table strewn dust definition popular disagree saying proven
greek probably borrowing northwest semitic language perhaps phoenician cognate hebrew word ʾābāq dust post biblical sense meaning sand used writing surface

roman model like modern korean japanese plus bead per decimal place standard suanpan plus
incidentally allows use hexadecimal numeral system base may used traditional chinese measures weight
instead running wires chinese korean japanese models beads roman model run grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower
another possible source suanpan chinese counting rods operated decimal system lacked concept zero place holder
zero probably introduced chinese tang dynasty travel indian ocean middle east would provided direct contact india allowing acquire concept zero decimal point indian merchants mathematicians

learning calculate abacus one improve one mental calculation becomes faster accurate large number calculations
abacus based mental calculation amc derived abacus means calculation including addition subtraction multiplication division mind imagined abacus
high level cognitive skill runs calculations effective algorithm
people long term amc training show higher numerical memory capacity effectively connected neural pathways
able retrieve memory deal complex processes calculate
processing amc involves visuospatial visuomotor processing generate visual abacus perform movement imaginary bead
since thing needed remembered final position beads takes less memory less computation time
