skeleton aardvark aardvark orycteropus afer medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native africa
living species order tubulidentata although prehistoric species genera tubulidentata known
unlike insectivores long pig like snout used sniff food
roams southern two thirds african continent avoiding areas mainly rocky
nocturnal feeder subsists ants termites dig hills using sharp claws powerful legs
also digs create burrows live rear young
receives least concern rating iucn although numbers seem decreasing
aardvarks afrotheres clade also includes elephants manatees hyraxes
name aardvark sometimes colloquially called african ant bear anteater confused south american anteater cape anteater cape good hope
name aardvark afrikaans comes earlier afrikaans erdvark means earth pig ground pig aarde earth ground vark pig burrowing habits
name orycteropus means burrowing foot name afer refers africa
name aardvarks order tubulidentata comes tubule style teeth
taxonomy skull aardvark aardvark closely related pig rather sole extant representative obscure mammalian order tubulidentata usually considered form one variable species genus orycteropus sole surviving genus family orycteropodidae
aardvark closely related south american anteater despite sharing characteristics superficial resemblance
similarities based convergent evolution
closest living relatives aardvark elephant shrews tenrecs golden moles
along sirenians hyraxes elephants extinct relatives animals form superorder afrotheria
studies brain shown similarities condylarthra given clade status wastebasket taxon may mean species traditionally classified condylarths actually stem aardvarks
evolutionary history based fossils bryan patterson concluded early relatives aardvark appeared africa around end paleocene
ptolemaiidans mysterious clade mammals uncertain affinities may actually stem aardvarks either sister clade tubulidentata grade leading true tubulidentates
first unambiguous tubulidentate probably myorycteropus africanus kenyan miocene deposits
earliest example genus orycteropus orycteropus mauritanicus found algeria deposits middle miocene equally old version found kenya
fossils aardvark dated million years located throughout europe near east
mysterious pleistocene madagascar originally thought tubulidentate descended ancestors entered island eocene
however number subtle anatomical differences coupled recent molecular evidence lead researchers believe relative golden moles tenrecs achieved aardvark like appearance ecological niche convergent evolution

aardvark weight typically
aardvark length usually reach lengths tail taken account
tall shoulder girth
largest member proposed clade
aardvark pale yellowish gray color often stained reddish brown soil
aardvark coat thin animal primary protection tough skin
hair short head tail however legs tend longer hair
hair majority body grouped clusters hairs
hair surrounding nostrils dense help filter particulate matter digs
tail thick base gradually tapers
head greatly elongated head set short thick neck end snout bears disc houses nostrils
contains thin complete zygomatic arch
head aardvark contains many unique different features
one distinctive characteristics tubulidentata teeth
instead pulp cavity tooth cluster thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes vasodentin modified form dentine individual pulp canals held together cementum
number columns dependent size tooth largest
teeth enamel coating worn away regrow continuously
aardvark born conventional incisors canines front jaw fall replaced
adult aardvarks cheek teeth back jaw dental formula remaining teeth peg like rootless unique composition
teeth consist upper lower jaw molars
nasal area aardvark another unique area contains ten nasal conchae placental mammal
sides nostrils thick hair
tip snout highly mobile moved modified mimetic muscles
fleshy dividing tissue nostrils probably sensory functions uncertain whether olfactory vibratory nature
nose made turbinate bones mammal compared dogs
large quantity turbinate bones aardvark space moist epithelium location olfactory bulb
nose contains nine olfactory bulbs mammal
keen sense smell quantity bulbs nose also development brain olfactory lobe developed
snout resembles elongated pig snout
mouth small tubular typical species feed ants termites
aardvark long thin snakelike protruding tongue much long elaborate structures supporting keen sense smell
ears effective long long
eyes small head consist rods
digestive system aardvark stomach muscular pyloric area acts gizzard grind swallowed food thereby rendering chewing unnecessary
cecum large
sexes emit strong smelling secretion anal gland
salivary glands highly developed almost completely ring neck output causes tongue maintain tackiness
female two pairs teats inguinal region
genetically speaking aardvark living fossil chromosomes highly conserved reflecting much early eutherian arrangement divergence major modern taxa
aardvarks found sub saharan africa suitable habitat savannas grasslands woodlands bushland food ants termites available
spend daylight hours dark burrows avoid heat day
major habitat present swamp forest high water table precludes digging sufficient depth
also avoid terrain rocky enough cause problems digging
documented high ethiopia
present throughout sub saharan africa way south africa exceptions
exceptions include coastal areas namibia ivory coast ghana
found madagascar
aardvark resting entrance burrow emerging burrow aardvarks live years captivity
keen hearing warns predators lions leopards cheetahs african wild dogs hyenas pythons
humans also hunt aardvarks meat
aardvarks dig fast run zigzag fashion elude enemies else fails strike claws tail shoulders sometimes flipping onto backs lying motionless except lash four feet
capable causing substantial damage unprotected areas attacker
also dig escape pressed dig extremely quickly
feeding aardvark nocturnal solitary creature feeds almost exclusively ants termites myrmecophagy fruit eaten aardvarks aardvark cucumber
fact cucumber aardvark symbiotic relationship eat subterranean fruit defecate seeds near burrows grow rapidly due loose soil fertile nature area
time spent intestine aardvark helps fertility seed fruit provides needed moisture aardvark
avoid eating african driver ant red ants
due stringent diet requirements require large range survive
aardvark emerges burrow late afternoon shortly sunset forages considerable home range encompassing
foraging food aardvark keep nose ground ears pointed forward indicates smell hearing involved search food
zig zag forage usually repeat route days appear allow time termite nests recover feeding
foraging period stop dig shaped trench forefeet sniff profusely means explore location
concentration ants termites detected aardvark digs powerful front legs keeping long ears upright listen predators takes astonishing number insects long sticky tongue many one night recorded
claws enable dig extremely hard crust termite ant mound quickly
avoids inhaling dust sealing nostrils
successful aardvark long tongue licks insects termites biting ants stinging attacks rendered futile tough skin
aardvark visit termite mound animals visit pick leftovers
termite mounds alone provide enough food aardvark look termites move
insects move form columns long tend provide easy pickings little effort exerted aardvark
columns common areas livestock hoofed animals
trampled grass dung attract termites odontotermes microtermes genera
nightly basis tend active first portion night roughly four hours

however seem prefer bright dark nights
adverse weather disturbed retreat burrow systems
cover per night however studies shown may traverse far night
vocalization aardvark rather quiet animal
however make soft grunting sounds forages loud grunts makes tunnel entrance
makes bleating sound frightened
threatened make one burrows
one close dig new one rapidly
new one short require aardvark back coast clear
movement aardvark known good swimmer witnessed successfully swimming strong currents
dig yard tunnel five minutes otherwise moves fairly slowly
leaving burrow night pause entrance ten minutes sniffing listening
period watchfulness bound within seconds away
pause prick ears twisting head listen jump move start foraging
aside digging ants termites aardvark also excavates burrows live generally fall one three categories burrows made foraging refuge resting location permanent homes
temporary sites scattered around home range used refuges main burrow also used breeding
main burrows deep extensive several entrances long
burrows large enough man enter
aardvark changes layout home burrow regularly periodically moves makes new one
old burrows important part african wildlife scene
vacated inhabited smaller animals like african wild dog ant eating chat nycteris thebaica warthogs
animals use hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons lizards
without refuges many animals would die wildfire season
mothers young share burrows however aardvark known live small family groups solitary creature
attacked tunnel escape digging tunnel thereby placing fresh fill predator decides fight roll onto back attack claws
aardvark known sleep recently excavated ant nest also serves protection predators
reproduction aardvark mother young aardvarks pair breeding season gestation period seven months one cub weighing around born may july
born young flaccid ears many wrinkles
nursing nurse teat succession
two weeks folds skin disappear three ears held upright
weeks body hair starts growing
able leave burrow accompany mother two weeks eats termites weeks weaned three months weeks
six months age able dig burrows often remain mother next mating season sexually mature approximately two years age
aardvarks thought declining numbers however possibly readily seen
definitive counts nocturnal secretive habits however numbers seem stable overall
considered common anywhere africa due large range maintain sufficient numbers
may slight decrease numbers eastern northern western africa
southern african numbers decreasing
receives official designation iucn least concern
however species precarious situation dependent specific food therefore problem arises abundance termites species whole would affected drastically
