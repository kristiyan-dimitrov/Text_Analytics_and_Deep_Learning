name austroasiatic comes combination latin words south asia hence south asia
regarding word structure austroasiatic languages well known iambic sesquisyllabic pattern basic nouns verbs consisting initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed stressed full syllable
reduction presyllables led variety among modern languages phonological shapes original proto austroasiatic prefixes causative prefix ranging cvc syllables consonant clusters single consonants
word formation austroasiatic languages variety derivational prefixes many infixes suffixes almost completely non existent branches except munda specialized exceptions austroasiatic branches
austroasiatic languages characterized unusually large vowel inventories employing sort register contrast either modal normal voice breathy lax voice modal voice creaky voice
languages pearic branch vietic branch three even four way voicing contrast
however austroasiatic languages lost register contrast evolving diphthongs cases vietnamese tonogenesis
vietnamese heavily influenced chinese original austroasiatic phonological quality obscured resembles south chinese languages whereas khmer influence sanskrit retained typically austroasiatic structure

however evidence classification ever published
families written boldface type accepted valid clade
contrast relationships families within austroasiatic debated

sidwell paul sidwell roger blench propose austroasiatic phylum dispersed via mekong river drainage basin
paul sidwell comparison languages well known enough exclude loan words finds little evidence internal branching though find area increased contact bahnaric katuic languages languages branches apart geographically distant munda nicobarese show greater similarity bahnaric katuic closer branches without noticeable innovations common bahnaric katuic
therefore takes conservative view thirteen branches austroasiatic treated equidistant current evidence
sidwell blench discuss proposal detail note good evidence khasi palaungic node could also possibly closely related khmuic
would case sidwell blench suggest khasic may early offshoot palaungic spread westward
sidwell blench suggest shompen additional branch believe vieto katuic connection worth investigating
general however family thought diversified quickly deeply nested structure developed since proto austroasiatic speakers believed sidwell radiated central mekong river valley relatively quickly
subsequently sidwell proposed nicobarese subgroups aslian khasian palaungic subgroup
subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis austroasiatic language family sidwell suggests austroasiatic branches may loosely nested structure rather completely rake like structure east west division consisting munda khasic palaungic khmuic forming western group opposed branches occurring possibly early years present
integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics recent archaeological findings paul sidwell expanded mekong riverine hypothesis proposing austroasiatic ultimately expanded indochina lingnan area southern china subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place initial arrival neolithic farmers southern china
sidwell tentatively suggests austroasiatic may begun split years
neolithic transition era mainland southeast asia major branches austroasiatic formed
austroasiatic would two possible dispersal routes western periphery pearl river watershed lingnan would either coastal route coast vietnam downstream mekong river via yunnan
reconstructed lexicon proto austroasiatic archaeological record clearly show early austroasiatic speakers around
cultivated rice millet kept livestock dogs pigs chickens thrived mostly estuarine rather coastal environments
neolithic package suddenly arrived indochina lingnan area without cereal grains displaced earlier pre neolithic hunter gatherer cultures grain husks found northern indochina
southern indochina
however sidwell found iron reconstructable proto austroasiatic since austroasiatic branch different terms iron borrowed relatively lately tai chinese tibetan malay languages
iron age relatively young austroasiatic branches indochina vietic katuic pearic khmer formed internally diverse bahnaric branch dating
underwent extensive internal diversification
iron age austroasiatic branches less present day locations diversification within austroasiatic taking place iron age
paul sidwell considers austroasiatic language family rapidly diversified around years
arrival rice agriculture indochina notes origin proto austroasiatic older date
lexicon proto austroasiatic divided early late stratum
early stratum consists basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features pronouns names cultural items agriculture terms words cultural artifacts reconstructable proto austroasiatic form part later stratum
roger blench suggests vocabulary related aquatic subsistence strategies boats waterways river fauna fish capture techniques reconstructed proto austroasiatic
blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots river valley boat fish catfish sp
eel prawn shrimp central austroasiatic crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird fish trap
archaeological evidence presence agriculture northern indochina northern vietnam laos nearby areas dates back years
bc agriculture ultimately introduced north yangtze valley dated
hence points relatively late riverine dispersal austroasiatic compared sino tibetan whose speakers distinct non riverine culture
addition living aquatic based lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would also access livestock crops newer types watercraft
early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways would encountered speakers older language families already settled area sino tibetan
possible extinct branches roger blench also proposes might primary branches austroasiatic extinct based substrate evidence modern day languages
pre chamic languages languages coastal vietnam prior chamic migrations
chamic various austroasiatic loanwords cannot clearly traced existing austroasiatic branches sidwell
larish also notes moklenic languages contain many austroasiatic loanwords similar ones found chamic
acehnese substratum sidwell
acehnese many basic words austroasiatic origin suggesting either austronesian speakers absorbed earlier austroasiatic residents northern sumatra words might borrowed austroasiatic languages southern vietnam perhaps combination
sidwell argues acehnese chamic often borrowed austroasiatic words independently austroasiatic words traced back proto aceh chamic
sidwell accepts acehnese chamic related separated chamic borrowed austroasiatic lexicon
bornean substrate languages blench
blench cites austroasiatic origin words modern day bornean branches land dayak bidayuh dayak bakatiq etc
dusunic central dusun visayan etc
kayan kenyah noting especially resemblances aslian
evidence proposal blench also cites ethnographic evidence musical instruments borneo shared common austroasiatic speaking groups mainland southeast asia
adelaar also noticed phonological lexical similarities land dayak aslian
lepcha substratum rongic
many words austroasiatic origin noticed lepcha suggesting sino tibetan superstrate laid austroasiatic substrate
blench calls branch rongic based lepcha autonym r√≥ng
languages proposed austroasiatic substrata jiamao based evidence register system jiamao hlai language thurgood
jiamao known highly aberrant vocabulary relation hlai languages
kerinci van reijn notes kerinci malayic language central sumatra shares many phonological similarities austroasiatic languages sesquisyllabic word structure vowel inventory
john peterson suggests pre munda languages may dominated eastern indo gangetic plain absorbed indo aryan languages early date indo aryan spread east
peterson notes eastern indo aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar munda languages western indo aryan languages
latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages written khmer thai lao burmese alphabets
vietnamese divergently indigenous script based chinese logographic writing
since supplanted latin alphabet th century
following examples past used alphabets current alphabets austroasiatic languages
ch·ªØ n√¥m khmer alphabet khom script used short period early th century indigenous languages laos mon script mundari bani mundari alphabet ol chiki alphabet santali alphabet pahawh hmong used write khmu name pahawh khmu sorang sompeng alphabet sora alphabet tai le palaung blang tai tham blang warang citi ho alphabet
austric languages austroasiatic integral part controversial austric hypothesis also includes austronesian languages proposals also kra dai languages hmong mien languages
hmong mien several lexical resemblances found hmong mien austroasiatic language families ratliff earlier proposed haudricourt
could imply relation early language contact along yangtze
according cai et al
hmong mien least partially related austroasiatic heavily influenced sino tibetan especially tibeto burman languages
indo aryan languages suggested austroasiatic languages influence indo aryan languages including sanskrit middle indo aryan languages
indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed specific number substantives languages hindi punjabi bengali borrowed munda languages
additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested similarity tales austroasiatic realm indian mythological stories matsyagandha mahabharata nƒÅgas
mitsuru sakitani suggests haplogroup common austroasiatic people ethnic groups southern china haplogroup common today japanese koreans manchu carriers yangtze civilization baiyue
another study suggests haplogroup major austroasiatic paternal lineage para austroasiatic lineage yayoi people
migration india according chaubey et al austro asiatic speakers india today derived dispersal southeast asia followed extensive sex specific admixture local indian populations
according riccio et al munda people likely descended austroasiatic migrants southeast asia
according zhang et al austroasiatic migrations southeast asia india took place last glacial maximum circa years ago
arunkumar et al
suggest austroasiatic migrations southeast asia occurred northeast india kya east india kya
