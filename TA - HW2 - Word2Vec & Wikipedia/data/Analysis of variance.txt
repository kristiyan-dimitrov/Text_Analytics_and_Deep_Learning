analysis variance anova collection statistical models associated estimation procedures variation among groups used analyze differences among group means sample
anova developed statistician ronald fisher
anova based law total variance observed variance particular variable partitioned components attributable different sources variation
simplest form anova provides statistical test whether two population means different therefore generalizes test beyond two means
analysis variance reached fruition th century antecedents extend centuries past according stigler
include hypothesis testing partitioning sums squares experimental techniques additive model
laplace performing hypothesis testing
around laplace gauss developed least squares method combining observations improved upon methods used astronomy geodesy
also initiated much study contributions sums squares
laplace knew estimate variance residual rather total sum squares
laplace using least squares methods address anova problems regarding measurements atmospheric tides
astronomers isolated observational errors resulting reaction times personal equation developed methods reducing errors
experimental methods used study personal equation later accepted emerging field psychology developed strong full factorial experimental methods randomization blinding soon added
eloquent non mathematical explanation additive effects model available
ronald fisher introduced term variance proposed formal analysis article correlation relatives supposition mendelian inheritance
first application analysis variance published
analysis variance became widely known included fisher book statistical methods research workers
randomization models developed several researchers
first published polish jerzy neyman
one attributes anova ensured early popularity computational elegance
structure additive model allows solution additive coefficients simple algebra rather matrix calculations
era mechanical calculators simplicity critical
determination statistical significance also required access tables function supplied early statistics texts
fit young vs old short haired vs long haired fair fit pet vs working breed less athletic vs athleticvery good fit weight breedthe analysis variance used exploratory tool explain observations
dog show provides example
dog show random sampling breed typically limited dogs adult pure bred exemplary
histogram dog weights show might plausibly rather complex like yellow orange distribution shown illustrations
suppose wanted predict weight dog based certain set characteristics dog
one way explain distribution weights dividing dog population groups based characteristics
successful grouping split dogs group low variance dog weights meaning group relatively homogeneous mean group distinct two groups mean reasonable conclude groups fact separate meaningful way
illustrations right groups identified etc
first illustration dogs divided according product interaction two binary groupings young vs old short haired vs long haired group young short haired dogs group young long haired dogs etc
since distributions dog weight within groups shown blue relatively large variance since means similar across groups grouping dogs characteristics produce effective way explain variation dog weights knowing group dog allow us predict weight much better simply knowing dog dog show
thus grouping fails explain variation overall distribution yellow orange
attempt explain weight distribution grouping dogs pet vs working breed less athletic vs athletic would probably somewhat successful fair fit
heaviest show dogs likely big strong working breeds breeds kept pets tend smaller thus lighter
shown second illustration distributions variances considerably smaller first case means distinguishable
however significant overlap distributions example means cannot distinguish reliably
grouping dogs according coin flip might produce distributions look similar
attempt explain weight breed likely produce good fit
chihuahuas light st bernards heavy
difference weights setters pointers justify separate breeds
analysis variance provides formal tools justify intuitive judgments
common use method analysis experimental data development models
method advantages correlation data must numeric one result method judgment confidence explanatory relationship
anova form statistical hypothesis testing heavily used analysis experimental data
test result calculated null hypothesis sample called statistically significant deemed unlikely occurred chance assuming truth null hypothesis
statistically significant result probability value less pre specified threshold significance level justifies rejection null hypothesis priori probability null hypothesis high
typical application anova null hypothesis groups random samples population
example studying effect different treatments similar samples patients null hypothesis would treatments effect perhaps none
rejecting null hypothesis taken mean differences observed effects treatment groups unlikely due random chance
construction hypothesis testing limits rate type errors false positives significance level
experimenters also wish limit type ii errors false negatives
rate type ii errors depends largely sample size rate larger smaller samples significance level standard proof high chances overlooking discovery also high effect size smaller effect size prone type ii error
terminology anova largely statistical design experiments
experimenter adjusts factors measures responses attempt determine effect
factors assigned experimental units combination randomization blocking ensure validity results
blinding keeps weighing impartial
responses show variability partially result effect partially random error
anova synthesis several ideas used multiple purposes
consequence difficult define concisely precisely
classical anova balanced data three things short anova statistical tool used several ways develop confirm explanation observed data
additionally result anova long enjoyed status used would say abused statistical technique psychological research
anova probably useful technique field statistical inference
anova difficult teach particularly complex experiments split plot designs notorious
cases proper application method best determined problem pattern recognition followed consultation classic authoritative test
design experiments terms condensed nist engineering statistics handbook section
glossary doe terminology
balanced design experimental design cells
treatment combinations number observations
blocking schedule conducting treatment combinations experimental study effects experimental results due known change raw materials operators machines etc become concentrated levels blocking variable
reason blocking isolate systematic effect prevent obscuring main effects
blocking achieved restricting randomization
design set experimental runs allows fit particular model estimate effects
doe design experiments
approach problem solving involving collection data support valid defensible supportable conclusions
effect changing settings factor changes response
effect single factor also called main effect
error unexplained variation collection observations
doe typically require understanding random error lack fit error
experimental unit entity specific treatment combination applied
factors process inputs investigator manipulates cause change output
lack fit error error occurs analysis omits one important terms factors process model
including replication doe allows separation experimental error components lack fit random pure error
model mathematical relationship relates changes given response changes one factors
random error error occurs due natural variation process
random error typically assumed normally distributed zero mean constant variance
random error also called experimental error
randomization schedule allocating treatment material conducting treatment combinations doe conditions one run neither depend conditions previous run predict conditions subsequent runs
replication performing treatment combination
including replication allows estimate random error independent lack fit error
responses output process
sometimes called dependent variable
treatment treatment specific combination factor levels whose effect compared treatments
three classes models used analysis variance outlined
fixed effects models fixed effects model class analysis variance applies situations experimenter applies one treatments subjects experiment see whether response variable values change
allows experimenter estimate ranges response variable values treatment would generate population whole
random effects models random effects model class ii used treatments fixed
occurs various factor levels sampled larger population
levels random variables assumptions method contrasting treatments multi variable generalization simple differences differ fixed effects model
mixed effects models mixed effects model class iii contains experimental factors fixed random effects types appropriately different interpretations analysis two types
example teaching experiments could performed college university department find good introductory textbook text considered treatment
fixed effects model would compare list candidate texts
random effects model would determine whether important differences exist among list randomly selected texts
mixed effects model would compare fixed incumbent texts randomly selected alternatives
defining fixed random effects proven elusive competing definitions arguably leading toward linguistic quagmire
analysis variance studied several approaches common uses linear model relates response treatments blocks
note model linear parameters may nonlinear across factor levels
interpretation easy data balanced across factors much deeper understanding needed unbalanced data
textbook analysis using normal distribution analysis variance presented terms linear model makes following assumptions probability distribution responses independence observations assumption model simplifies statistical analysis
normality distributions residuals normal
equality homogeneity variances called variance data groups
separate assumptions textbook model imply errors independently identically normally distributed fixed effects models errors independent randomization based analysis randomized controlled experiment treatments randomly assigned experimental units following experimental protocol
randomization objective declared experiment carried
objective random assignment used test significance null hypothesis following ideas peirce ronald fisher
design based analysis discussed developed francis anscombe rothamsted experimental station oscar kempthorne iowa state university
kempthorne students make assumption unit treatment additivity discussed books kempthorne david cox
unit treatment additivity simplest form assumption unit treatment additivity states observed response experimental unit receiving treatment written sum unit response treatment effect assumption unit treatment additivity implies every treatment th treatment exactly effect every experiment unit
assumption unit treatment additivity usually cannot directly falsified according cox kempthorne
however many consequences treatment unit additivity falsified
randomized experiment assumption unit treatment additivity implies variance constant treatments
therefore contraposition necessary condition unit treatment additivity variance constant
use unit treatment additivity randomization similar design based inference standard finite population survey sampling
derived linear model kempthorne uses randomization distribution assumption unit treatment additivity produce derived linear model similar textbook model discussed previously
test statistics derived linear model closely approximated test statistics appropriate normal linear model according approximation theorems simulation studies
however differences
example randomization based analysis results small strictly negative correlation observations
randomization based analysis assumption normal distribution certainly assumption independence
contrary observations dependent
randomization based analysis disadvantage exposition involves tedious algebra extensive time
since randomization based analysis complicated closely approximated approach using normal linear model teachers emphasize normal linear model approach
statisticians object model based analysis balanced randomized experiments
statistical models observational data however applied data non randomized experiments observational studies model based analysis lacks warrant randomization
observational data derivation confidence intervals must use subjective models emphasized ronald fisher followers
practice estimates treatment effects observational studies generally often inconsistent
practice statistical models observational data useful suggesting hypotheses treated cautiously public
summary assumptions normal model based anova analysis assumes independence normality homogeneity variances residuals
randomization based analysis assumes homogeneity variances residuals consequence unit treatment additivity uses randomization procedure experiment
analyses require assumption normal model analysis consequence randomization additivity randomization based analysis
however studies processes change variances rather means called dispersion effects successfully conducted using anova
necessary assumptions anova full generality test used anova hypothesis testing assumptions practical limitations continuing interest
problems satisfy assumptions anova often transformed satisfy assumptions
property unit treatment additivity invariant change scale statisticians often use transformations achieve unit treatment additivity
response variable expected follow parametric family probability distributions statistician may specify protocol experiment observational study responses transformed stabilize variance
also statistician may specify logarithmic transforms applied responses believed follow multiplicative model
according cauchy functional equation theorem logarithm continuous transformation transforms real multiplication addition
anova used analysis comparative experiments difference outcomes interest
statistical significance experiment determined ratio two variances
ratio independent several possible alterations experimental observations adding constant observations alter significance
multiplying observations constant alter significance
anova statistical significance result independent constant bias scaling errors well units used expressing observations
era mechanical calculation common subtract constant observations equivalent dropping leading digits simplify data entry
example data coding
calculations anova characterized computing number means variances dividing two variances comparing ratio handbook value determine statistical significance
calculating treatment effect trivial effect treatment estimated taking difference mean observations receive treatment general mean
partitioning sum squares anova uses traditional standardized terminology
definitional equation sample variance divisor called degrees freedom df summation called sum squares ss result called mean square ms squared terms deviations sample mean
anova estimates sample variances total variance based observation deviations grand mean error variance based observation deviations appropriate treatment means treatment variance
treatment variance based deviations treatment means grand mean result multiplied number observations treatment account difference variance observations variance means
fundamental technique partitioning total sum squares ss components related effects used model
example model simplified anova one type treatment different levels
number degrees freedom df partitioned similar way one components error specifies chi squared distribution describes associated sum squares true treatments treatment effect
see also lack fit sum squares
test test used comparing factors total deviation
example one way single factor anova statistical significance tested comparing test statistic ms mean square number treatments total number cases distribution degrees freedom
using distribution natural candidate test statistic ratio two scaled sums squares follows scaled chi squared distribution
expected value treatment sample size treatment effect
values increase evidence increasingly inconsistent null hypothesis
two apparent experimental methods increasing increasing sample size reducing error variance tight experimental controls
two methods concluding anova hypothesis test produce result textbook method compare observed value critical value determined tables
critical value function degrees freedom numerator denominator significance level
fcritical null hypothesis rejected
computer method calculates probability value value greater equal observed value
null hypothesis rejected probability less equal significance level
anova test known nearly optimal sense minimizing false negative errors fixed rate false positive errors
maximizing power fixed significance level
example test hypothesis various medical treatments exactly effect test values closely approximate permutation test values approximation particularly close design balanced
permutation tests characterize tests maximum power alternative hypotheses observed rosenbaum
anova test null hypothesis treatments exactly effect recommended practical test robustness many alternative distributions
extended logic anova consists separable parts partitioning sources variance hypothesis testing used individually
anova used support statistical tools
regression first used fit complex models data anova used compare models objective selecting simple models adequately describe data
models could fit without reference anova anova tools could used make sense fitted models test hypotheses batches coefficients
think analysis variance way understanding structuring multilevel models alternative regression tool summarizing complex high dimensional inferences
simplest experiment suitable anova analysis completely randomized experiment single factor
complex experiments single factor involve constraints randomization include completely randomized blocks latin squares variants graeco latin squares etc
complex experiments share many complexities multiple factors
relatively complete discussion analysis models data summaries anova table completely randomized experiment available
anova generalizes study effects multiple factors
experiment includes observations combinations levels factor termed factorial
factorial experiments efficient series single factor experiments efficiency grows number factors increases
consequently factorial designs heavily used
use anova study effects multiple factors complication
way anova factors anova model includes terms main effects terms interactions xy xz yz xyz
terms require hypothesis tests
proliferation interaction terms increases risk hypothesis test produce false positive chance
fortunately experience says high order interactions rare
ability detect interactions major advantage multiple factor anova
testing one factor time hides interactions produces apparently inconsistent experimental results
caution advised encountering interactions test interaction terms first expand analysis beyond anova interactions found
texts vary recommendations regarding continuation anova procedure encountering interaction
interactions complicate interpretation experimental data
neither calculations significance estimated treatment effects taken face value
significant interaction often mask significance main effects
graphical methods recommended enhance understanding
regression often useful
lengthy discussion interactions available cox
interactions removed transformations others cannot
variety techniques used multiple factor anova reduce expense
one technique used factorial designs minimize replication possibly replication support analytical trickery combine groups effects found statistically practically insignificant
experiment many insignificant factors may collapse one factors supported many replications
numerous fully worked numerical examples available standard textbooks online
simple case uses one way single factor analysis
analysis required support design experiment analysis performed changes factors formally found produce statistically significant changes responses
experimentation iterative results one experiment alter plans following experiments
preparatory analysis number experimental units design experiment number experimental units planned satisfy goals experiment
experimentation often sequential
early experiments often designed provide mean unbiased estimates treatment effects experimental error
later experiments often designed test hypothesis treatment effect important magnitude case number experimental units chosen experiment within budget adequate power among goals
reporting sample size analysis generally required psychology
provide information sample size process led sample size decisions
analysis written experimental protocol experiment conducted examined grant applications administrative review boards
besides power analysis less formal methods selecting number experimental units
include graphical methods based limiting probability false negative errors graphical methods based expected variation increase residuals methods based achieving desired confidence interval
power analysis power analysis often applied context anova order assess probability successfully rejecting null hypothesis assume certain anova design effect size population sample size significance level
power analysis assist study design determining sample size would required order reasonable chance rejecting null hypothesis alternative hypothesis true
effect size several standardized measures effect proposed anova summarize strength association predictor dependent variable overall standardized difference complete model
standardized effect size estimates facilitate comparison findings across studies disciplines
however standardized effect sizes commonly used much professional literature non standardized measure effect size immediately meaningful units may preferable reporting purposes
follow analysis always appropriate carefully consider outliers
impact statistical conclusions often result errors
model confirmation prudent verify assumptions anova met
residuals examined analyzed confirm gross normality
residuals appearance zero mean normal distribution noise plotted function anything including time modeled data values
trends hint interactions among factors among observations
one rule thumb largest standard deviation less twice smallest standard deviation use methods based assumption equal standard deviations results still approximately correct
follow tests statistically significant effect anova often followed one different follow tests
done order assess groups different groups test various focused hypotheses
follow tests often distinguished terms whether planned priori post hoc
planned tests determined looking data post hoc tests performed looking data
often one treatments none treatment group act control
dunnett test modification test tests whether treatment groups mean control
post hoc tests tukey range test commonly compare every group mean every group mean typically incorporate method controlling type errors
comparisons commonly planned either simple compound
simple comparisons compare one group mean one group mean
compound comparisons typically compare two sets groups means one set two groups compare average group means group group
comparisons also look tests trend linear quadratic relationships independent variable involves ordered levels
following anova pair wise multiple comparison tests criticized several grounds
many tests one table recommendations regarding use vague conflicting
several types anova
many statisticians base anova design experiment especially protocol specifies random assignment treatments subjects protocol description assignment mechanism include specification structure treatments blocking
also common apply anova observational data using appropriate statistical model
popular designs use following types anova one way anova used test differences among two independent groups means
different levels urea application crop different levels antibiotic action several different bacterial species different levels effect medicine groups patients
however groups independent order groups mild moderate severe disease dose drug mg ml mg ml mg ml given group patients linear trend estimation used
typically however one way anova used test differences among least three groups since two group case covered test
two means compare test anova test equivalent relation anova given
factorial anova used experimenter wants study interaction effects among treatments
repeated measures anova used subjects used treatment longitudinal study
multivariate analysis variance manova used one response variable
balanced experiments equal sample size treatment relatively easy interpret unbalanced experiments offer complexity
single factor one way anova adjustment unbalanced data easy unbalanced analysis lacks robustness power
complex designs lack balance leads complications
orthogonality property main effects interactions present balanced data carry unbalanced case
means usual analysis variance techniques apply
consequently analysis unbalanced factorials much difficult balanced designs
general case analysis variance also applied unbalanced data sums squares mean squares ratios depend order sources variation considered
simplest techniques handling unbalanced data restore balance either throwing data synthesizing missing data
complex techniques use regression
anova part test statistical significance
american psychological association many organisations holds view simply reporting statistical significance insufficient reporting confidence bounds preferred
anova conservative maintaining significance level multiple comparisons one dimension conservative comparisons multiple dimensions
common mistake use anova kruskal wallis analysis ordered groups
time sequence changes months disease severity mild moderate severe distance set point km km km
data three ordered groups defined researcher analysed linear trend estimation
anova considered special case linear regression turn special case general linear model
consider observations sum model fit residual error minimized
kruskal wallis test friedman test nonparametric tests rely assumption normality
connection linear regression make clear connection multi way anova linear regression
linearly order data observation associated response factors denotes different factors total number factors
one way anova two way anova
furthermore assume factor levels namely
one hot encode factors dimensional vector
one hot encoding function defined entry vector concatenation vectors
thus
order obtain fully general way interaction anova must also concatenate every additional interaction term vector add intercept term
let vector
notation place exact connection linear regression
simply regress response vector
however concern identifiability
order overcome issues assume sum parameters within set interactions equal zero
one use statistics methods determine relevance individual factors
example consider way interaction example assume first factor levels second factor levels
define
one hot encoding first factor one hot encoding second factor
last term intercept term
concrete example suppose
one way analysis variance one way anova two way analysis variance two way anova anova ranks anova simultaneous component analysis analysis covariance ancova analysis molecular variance amova analysis rhythmic variance anorva explained variation linear trend estimation mixed design analysis variance multivariate analysis variance manova multivariate analysis covariance mancova permutational analysis variance repeated measures anova variance decomposition expected mean squares
