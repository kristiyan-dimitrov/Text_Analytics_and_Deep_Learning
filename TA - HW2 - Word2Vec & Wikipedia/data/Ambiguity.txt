ambiguity type meaning phrase statement resolution explicitly defined making several interpretations plausible
common aspect ambiguity uncertainty
thus attribute idea statement whose intended meaning cannot definitively resolved according rule process finite number steps
ambi part term reflects idea two two meanings
concept ambiguity generally contrasted vagueness
ambiguity specific distinct interpretations permitted although may immediately obvious whereas information vague difficult form interpretation desired level specificity
context may play role resolving ambiguity
example piece information may ambiguous one context unambiguous another
lexical ambiguity contrasted semantic ambiguity
former represents choice finite number known meaningful context dependent interpretations
latter represents choice number possible interpretations none may standard agreed upon meaning
form ambiguity closely related vagueness
linguistic ambiguity problem law interpretation written documents oral agreements often paramount importance structural analysis ambiguous spanish sentence pepe vio pablo enfurecido interpretation pepe angry saw pepe saw pablo angry syntactic tree figure represents interpretation
lexical ambiguity lexical ambiguity word phrase pertains one meaning language word belongs
meaning refers whatever captured good dictionary
instance word bank several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution edge river
consider apothecary
one could say bought herbs apothecary
could mean one actually spoke apothecary pharmacist went apothecary pharmacy
context ambiguous word used often makes evident meanings intended
instance someone says buried bank people would think someone used shovel dig mud
however linguistic contexts provide sufficient information disambiguate used word
lexical ambiguity addressed algorithmic methods automatically associate appropriate meaning word context task referred word sense disambiguation
use multi defined words requires author speaker clarify context sometimes elaborate specific intended meaning case less ambiguous term used
goal clear concise communication receiver meant conveyed
exception could include politician whose weasel words obfuscation necessary gain support multiple constituents mutually exclusive conflicting desires candidate choice
ambiguity powerful tool political science
problematic words whose senses express closely related concepts
good example mean useful functional good hammer exemplary good student pleasing good soup moral good person versus lesson learned story righteous etc
good daughter clear sense intended

semantic syntactic ambiguity semantic ambiguity occurs word phrase sentence taken context one interpretation
saw duck example due richard nordquist words duck refer either person bird noun duck modified possessive pronoun motion made verb duck subject objective pronoun object verb saw
syntactic ambiguity arises sentence two different meanings structure sentence syntax
often due modifying expression prepositional phrase application unclear
ate cookies couch example could mean ate cookies couch opposed table could mean sitting couch ate cookies
get need entrance fee voucher drivers license
could mean need either ten dollars voucher license
could mean need license need either ten dollars voucher
rewriting sentence placing appropriate punctuation resolve syntactic ambiguity
notion theoretic results syntactic ambiguity artificial formal languages computer programming languages see ambiguous grammar
usually semantic syntactic ambiguity go hand hand
sentence saw duck also syntactically ambiguous
conversely sentence like ate cookies couch also semantically ambiguous
rarely occasionally different parsings syntactically ambiguous phrase result meaning
example command cook cook
parsed cook noun used vocative cook imperative verb form
also cook imperative verb form cook noun used vocative
common syntactically unambiguous phrase semantic ambiguity example lexical ambiguity boss funny man purely semantic leading response funny ha ha funny peculiar
spoken language contain many types ambiguities called phonological ambiguities one way compose set sounds words
example ice cream scream
ambiguity generally resolved according context
mishearing based incorrectly resolved ambiguity called mondegreen
metonymy involves referring one entity name different closely related entity example using wheels refer car wall street refer stock exchanges located street even entire us financial sector
modern vocabulary critical semiotics metonymy encompasses potentially ambiguous word substitution based contextual contiguity located close together function process object performs sweet ride refer nice car
metonym considered primary mechanism linguistic humor
philosophers users logic spend lot time effort searching removing intentionally adding ambiguity arguments lead incorrect conclusions used deliberately conceal bad arguments
example politician might say oppose taxes hinder economic growth example glittering generality
think opposes taxes general hinder economic growth
others may think opposes taxes believes hinder economic growth
writing sentence rewritten reduce possible either adding comma taxes convey first sense changing convey second sense rewriting ways
devious politician hopes constituent interpret statement desirable way think politician supports everyone opinion
however opposite also true opponent turn positive statement bad one speaker uses ambiguity intentionally
logical fallacies amphiboly equivocation rely heavily use ambiguous words phrases
continental philosophy particularly phenomenology existentialism much greater tolerance ambiguity generally seen integral part human condition

mathematical notation widely used physics sciences avoids many ambiguities compared expression natural language
however various reasons several lexical syntactic semantic ambiguities remain
names functions ambiguity style writing function confused multivalued function defined deterministic unambiguous way
several special functions still established notations
usually conversion another notation requires scale argument resulting value sometimes name function used causing confusions
examples functions sinc function elliptic integral third kind translating elliptic integral form maple mathematica one replace second argument square see talk elliptic integral list notations dealing complex values may cause problems
exponential integral hermite polynomial expressions ambiguous expressions often appear physical mathematical texts
common practice omit multiplication signs mathematical expressions
also common give name variable function example
one sees way distinguish whether means multiplied function evaluated argument equal
case use notations reader supposed able perform deduction reveal true meaning
creators algorithmic languages try avoid ambiguities
many algorithmic languages fortran require character symbol multiplication
wolfram language used mathematica allows user omit multiplication symbol requires square brackets indicate argument function square brackets allowed grouping expressions
fortran addition allow use name identifier different objects example function variable particular expression qualified error
order operations may depend context
programming languages operations division multiplication equal priority executed left right
last century many editorials assumed multiplication performed first example interpreted case insertion parentheses required translating formulas algorithmic language
addition common write argument function without parenthesis also may lead ambiguity
scientific journal style one uses roman letters denote elementary functions whereas variables written using italics
example mathematical journals expression denote sine function product three variables although informal notation slide presentation may stand
commas multi component subscripts superscripts sometimes omitted also potentially ambiguous notation
example notation reader infer context whether means single index object taken subscript equal product variables indication trivalent tensor
examples potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions expression understood mean either
often author intention understood context cases one two makes sense ambiguity like avoided example writing
expression means several texts though might thought mean since commonly means
conversely might seem mean exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration general means
however trigonometric hyperbolic functions notation conventionally means exponentiation result function application
expression interpreted meaning particular one thinks common acronym pemdas order operations implies ultiplication takes precedence ivision however commonly understood mean
notations quantum optics quantum mechanics common define coherent states quantum optics states fixed number photons
unwritten rule state coherent greek characters latin characters argument photon state latin characters dominate
ambiguity becomes even worse used states certain value coordinate means state certain value momentum may used books quantum mechanics
ambiguities easily lead confusions especially normalized adimensional dimensionless variables used
expression may mean state single photon coherent state mean amplitude equal state momentum equal unity
reader supposed guess context
ambiguous terms physics mathematics physical quantities yet established notations value sometimes even dimension case einstein coefficients depends system notations
many terms ambiguous
use ambiguous term preceded definition suitable specific case
like ludwig wittgenstein states tractatus logico philosophicus context proposition name meaning
highly confusing term gain
example sentence gain system doubled without context means close nothing
may mean ratio output voltage electric circuit input voltage doubled
may mean ratio output power electric optical circuit input power doubled
may mean gain laser medium doubled example doubling population upper laser level quasi two level system assuming negligible absorption ground state
term intensity ambiguous applied light
term refer irradiance luminous intensity radiant intensity radiance depending background person using term
also confusions may related use atomic percent measure concentration dopant resolution imaging system measure size smallest detail still resolved background statistical noise
