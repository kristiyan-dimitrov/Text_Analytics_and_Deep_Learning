alkali metals similar elements group
instance moving table known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing increasing reactivity decreasing melting boiling points well heats fusion vaporisation
general densities increase moving table exception potassium less dense sodium
atomic ionic radii effective nuclear charge atomic electron atomic radii alkali metals increase going group
shielding effect atom one electron shell electron feels electric repulsion electrons well electric attraction nucleus
alkali metals outermost electron feels net charge nuclear charge equal atomic number cancelled inner electrons number inner electrons alkali metal always one less nuclear charge
therefore factor affects atomic radius alkali metals number electron shells
since number increases group atomic radius must also increase group
ionic radii alkali metals much smaller atomic radii
outermost electron alkali metals different electron shell inner electrons thus removed resulting atom one fewer electron shell smaller
additionally effective nuclear charge increased thus electrons attracted strongly towards nucleus ionic radius decreases
first ionisation energy periodic trend ionisation energy period begins minimum alkali metals ends maximum noble gases
first ionisation energy element molecule energy required move loosely held electron one mole gaseous atoms element molecules form one mole gaseous ions electric charge
factors affecting first ionisation energy nuclear charge amount shielding inner electrons distance loosely held electron nucleus always outer electron main group elements
first two factors change effective nuclear charge loosely held electron feels
since outermost electron alkali metals always feels effective nuclear charge factor affects first ionisation energy distance outermost electron nucleus
since distance increases group outermost electron feels less attraction nucleus thus first ionisation energy decreases
trend broken francium due relativistic stabilisation contraction orbital bringing francium valence electron closer nucleus would expected non relativistic calculations
makes francium outermost electron feel attraction nucleus increasing first ionisation energy slightly beyond caesium
second ionisation energy alkali metals much higher first second loosely held electron part fully filled electron shell thus difficult remove
reactivity reactivities alkali metals increase going group
result combination two factors first ionisation energies atomisation energies alkali metals
first ionisation energy alkali metals decreases group easier outermost electron removed atom participate chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity group
atomisation energy measures strength metallic bond element falls group atoms increase radius thus metallic bond must increase length making delocalised electrons away attraction nuclei heavier alkali metals
adding atomisation first ionisation energies gives quantity closely related equal activation energy reaction alkali metal another substance
quantity decreases going group activation energy thus chemical reactions occur faster reactivity increases group

however sodium atom replaced lithium atom electrons attracted close chlorine atom lithium atom smaller making electron pair strongly attracted closer effective nuclear charge lithium
hence larger alkali metal atoms group less electronegative bonding pair less strongly attracted towards

melting boiling points melting point substance point changes state solid liquid boiling point substance liquid state point vapour pressure liquid equals environmental pressure surrounding liquid liquid changes state gas
metal heated melting point metallic bonds keeping atoms place weaken atoms move around metallic bonds eventually break completely metal boiling point
therefore falling melting boiling points alkali metals indicate strength metallic bonds alkali metals decreases group
metal atoms held together electromagnetic attraction positive ions delocalised electrons
atoms increase size going group atomic radius increases nuclei ions move away delocalised electrons hence metallic bond becomes weaker metal easily melt boil thus lowering melting boiling points
increased nuclear charge relevant factor due shielding effect
density alkali metals crystal structure body centred cubic thus relevant factors number atoms fit certain volume mass one atoms since density defined mass per unit volume
first factor depends volume atom thus atomic radius increases going group thus volume alkali metal atom increases going group
