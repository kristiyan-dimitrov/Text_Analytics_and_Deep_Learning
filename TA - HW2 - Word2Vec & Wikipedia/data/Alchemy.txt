english term often limited descriptions european alchemy similar practices existed far east indian subcontinent muslim world
europe following th century renaissance produced translation medieval islamic works science rediscovery aristotelian philosophy alchemists played significant role early modern science particularly chemistry medicine
islamic european alchemists developed structure basic laboratory techniques theory terminology experimental method still use today
however continued antiquity belief four elements guarded work secrecy including cyphers cryptic symbolism
work guided hermetic principles related magic mythology religion
modern discussions alchemy generally split examination exoteric practical applications esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms scholars holmyard von franz understood complementary
former pursued historians physical sciences examine subject terms early chemistry medicine charlatanism philosophical religious contexts events occurred
latter interests historians esotericism psychologists philosophers spiritualists
subject also made ongoing impact literature arts
despite split von franz believes existed since western traditions origin mix greek philosophy mixed egyptian mesopotamian technology numerous sources stressed integration esoteric exoteric approaches alchemy far back pseudo democritus first century physical mystical matters
although alchemy popularly associated magic historian lawrence principe argues recent historical research revealed medieval early modern alchemy embraced much diverse set ideas goals techniques practices readers probably aware several common claims alchemy example akin magic practice essentially deceptive
ideas alchemy emerged eighteenth century
might limited validity within narrow context none accurate depiction alchemy general
word alchemy comes old french alquemie alkimie used medieval latin alchymia
name brought arabic word al kīmiyā composed two parts late greek term khēmeía χημεία also spelled khumeia χυμεία khēmía χημία arabic definite article al meaning
together association interpreted process transmutation fuse reunite divine original form
several etymologies proposed greek term
first proposed zosimos panopolis rd th cent
ce derived name book khemeu
hermanm diels argued rather derived χύμα used describe metallic objects formed casting
others trace roots egyptian name kēme hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi meaning black earth refers fertile auriferous soil nile valley opposed red desert sand
according egyptologist wallis budge arabic word al kīmiyaʾ actually means egyptian science borrowing coptic word egypt kēme equivalent mediaeval bohairic dialect coptic khēme
coptic word derives demotic kmỉ ancient egyptian kmt
ancient egyptian word referred country colour black egypt black land contrast red land surrounding desert etymology could also explain nickname egyptian black arts
alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning four millennia three continents
traditions general penchant cryptic symbolic language makes hard trace mutual influences genetic relationships
one distinguish least three major strands appear mostly independent least earlier stages chinese alchemy centered china indian alchemy centered indian subcontinent western alchemy occurred around mediterranean whose center shifted millennia greco roman egypt islamic world finally medieval europe
chinese alchemy closely connected taoism indian alchemy dharmic faiths
contrast western alchemy developed philosophical system mostly independent influenced various western religions
still open question whether three strands share common origin extent influenced
hellenistic egypt zosimos marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs vol paris
start western alchemy may generally traced ancient hellenistic egypt city alexandria center alchemical knowledge retained pre eminence greek roman periods
following work andré jean festugière modern scholars see alchemical practice roman empire originating egyptian goldsmith art greek philosophy different religious traditions
tracing origins alchemical art egypt complicated pseudepigraphic nature texts greek alchemical corpus
treatises zosimos panopolis earliest historically attested author fl
ce however help situating authors
zosimus based work older alchemical authors mary jewess pseudo democritus agathodaimon little known authors
complete works four books pseudo democritus probably written first century ce
recent scholarship tend emphasizes testimony zosimus traced alchemical arts back egyptian metallurgical ceremonial practices
also argued early alchemical writers borrowed vocabulary greek philosophical schools implement doctrines systematic way
zosimos panopolis wrote final abstinence also known final count
zosimos explains ancient practice tinctures technical greek name alchemical arts taken certain demons taught art offered sacrifices
since zosimos also called demons gardians places οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι offered sacrifices priests ἱερέα fairly clear referring gods egypt priests
critical kind alchemy associated egyptian priests followers zosimos nonetheless saw tradition recent past rooted rites egyptian temples
mythology zosimos panopolis asserted alchemy dated back pharaonic egypt domain priestly class though little evidence assertion
alchemical writers used classical figures greek roman egyptian mythology illuminate works allegorize alchemical transmutation
included pantheon gods related classical planets isis osiris jason many others
central figure mythology alchemy hermes trismegistus thrice great hermes
name derived god thoth greek counterpart hermes
hermes caduceus serpent staff among alchemy principal symbols
according clement alexandria wrote called forty two books hermes covering fields knowledge
hermetica thrice great hermes generally understood form basis western alchemical philosophy practice called hermetic philosophy early practitioners
writings collected first centuries common era
technology dawn western alchemy sometimes associated metallurgy extending back
many writings lost emperor diocletian ordered burning alchemical books suppressing revolt alexandria
original egyptian documents alchemy survived notable among stockholm papyrus leyden papyrus
dating contained recipes dyeing making artificial gemstones cleaning fabricating pearls manufacturing imitation gold silver
writings lack mystical philosophical elements alchemy contain works bolus mendes pseudo democritus aligned recipes theoretical knowledge astrology classical elements
time bolus zosimos change took place transformed metallurgy hermetic art
philosophy alexandria acted melting pot philosophies pythagoreanism platonism stoicism gnosticism formed origin alchemy character
important example alchemy roots greek philosophy originated empedocles developed aristotle things universe formed four elements earth air water fire
according aristotle element sphere belonged would return left undisturbed
four elements greek mostly qualitative aspects matter quantitative modern elements true alchemy never regarded earth air water fire corporeal chemical substances present day sense word
four elements simply primary general qualities means amorphous purely quantitative substance bodies first reveals differentiated form
later alchemists extensively developed mystical aspects concept
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus prophesied birth
st augustine later affirmed th th centuries also condemned trismegistus idolatry
examples pagan christian jewish alchemists found period
greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos known pseudonyms moses isis cleopatra democritus ostanes
others authors komarios chymes know fragments text
greek alchemical writers occupied solely commenting works predecessors
middle th century alchemy almost entirely mystical discipline
time khalid ibn yazid sparked migration alexandria islamic world facilitating translation preservation greek alchemical texts th th centuries
india nd millennium bc text vedas describe connection eternal life gold
considerable knowledge metallurgy exhibited th century text called arthashastra provides ingredients explosives agniyoga salts extracted fertile soils plant remains yavakshara saltpetre nitre perfume making different qualities perfumes mentioned granulated refined sugar
buddhist texts nd th centuries mention transmutation base metals gold
according scholars greek alchemy may influenced indian alchemy hard evidences back claim

content sanskrit alchemical corpus yet adequately integrated wider general history alchemy
islamic world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered father chemistry introduced scientific experimental approach alchemy
fall roman empire focus alchemical development moved islamic world
much known islamic alchemy better documented indeed earlier writings come years preserved arabic translations
word alchemy derived arabic word al kīmiyā الكيمياء
early islamic world melting pot alchemy
platonic aristotelian thought already somewhat appropriated hermetical science continued assimilated late th early th centuries syriac translations scholarship
late th century jābir ibn hayyān latinized geber geberus introduced new approach alchemy based scientific methodology controlled experimentation laboratory contrast ancient greek egyptian alchemists whose works often allegorical unintelligible little concern laboratory work
jabir thus considered many father chemistry albeit others reserve title robert boyle antoine lavoisier
science historian paul kraus wrote jabir clearly recognized proclaimed importance experimentation early islamic chemists jabir ibn hayyan al kindi alkindus muhammad ibn zakarīya al rāzi rasis rhazes contributed number key chemical discoveries muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric nitric acids
discovery aqua regia mixture nitric hydrochloric acids could dissolve noblest metal gold fuel imagination alchemists next millennium
islamic philosophers also made great contributions alchemical hermeticism
influential author regard arguably jabir
jabir ultimate goal takwin artificial creation life alchemical laboratory including human life
analyzed aristotelian element terms four basic qualities hotness coldness dryness moistness
according jabir metal two qualities interior two exterior
example lead externally cold dry gold hot moist
thus jabir theorized rearranging qualities one metal different metal would result
reasoning search philosopher stone introduced western alchemy
jabir developed elaborate numerology whereby root letters substance name arabic treated various transformations held correspondences element physical properties
elemental system used medieval alchemy also originated jabir
original system consisted seven elements included five classical elements aether air earth fire water addition two chemical elements representing metals sulphur stone burns characterized principle combustibility mercury contained idealized principle metallic properties
shortly thereafter evolved eight elements arabic concept three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability combustion mercury giving volatility stability salt giving solidity
atomic theory physical bodies possess inner outer layer minute particles corpuscles also origins work jabir
th th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism variety practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū al rayhān al bīrūnī avicenna ibn khaldun
particular wrote refutations idea transmutation metals
east asia taoist alchemists often use alternate version taijitu
whereas european alchemy eventually centered transmutation base metals noble metals chinese alchemy obvious connection medicine
philosopher stone european alchemists compared grand elixir immortality sought chinese alchemists
however hermetic view two goals unconnected philosopher stone often equated universal panacea therefore two traditions may common initially appears
black powder may important invention chinese alchemists
previously stated chinese alchemy related medicine
said chinese invented gunpowder trying find potion eternal life
described th century texts used fireworks china th century used cannons
china use gunpowder spread japan mongols muslim world europe
gunpowder used mongols hungarians europe th century
chinese alchemy closely connected taoist forms traditional chinese medicine acupuncture moxibustion
early song dynasty followers taoist idea chiefly elite upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide though tolerable low levels led many suicide
thinking consequential death would lead freedom access taoist heavens ensuing deaths encouraged people eschew method alchemy favor external sources aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering qi etc
medieval europe alchemist search philosopher stone joseph wright illuminated page book alchemical processes receipts ca
th century
introduction alchemy latin europe may dated february completion robert chester translation arabic book composition alchemy
although european craftsmen technicians preexisted robert notes preface alchemy unknown latin europe time writing
translation arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished th century toledo spain contributors like gerard cremona adelard bath
translations time included turba philosophorum works avicenna al razi
brought many new words european vocabulary previous latin equivalent
alcohol carboy elixir athanor examples
meanwhile theologian contemporaries translators made strides towards reconciliation faith experimental rationalism thereby priming europe influx alchemical thought
th century st anselm put forth opinion faith rationalism compatible encouraged rationalism christian context
early th century peter abelard followed anselm work laying foundation acceptance aristotelian thought first works aristotle reached west
early th century robert grosseteste used abelard methods analysis added use observation experimentation conclusions conducting scientific investigations
grosseteste also much work reconcile platonic aristotelian thinking
much th th centuries alchemical knowledge europe remained centered translations new latin contributions made
efforts translators succeeded encyclopaedists
th century albertus magnus roger bacon notable work summarizing explaining newly imported alchemical knowledge aristotelian terms
albertus magnus dominican friar known written works book minerals observed commented operations theories alchemical authorities like hermes democritus unnamed alchemists time
albertus critically compared writings aristotle avicenna concerned transmutation metals
time shortly death th century alchemical tracts misattributed common practice giving rise reputation accomplished alchemist
likewise alchemical texts attributed albert student thomas aquinas
roger bacon franciscan friar wrote wide variety topics including optics comparative linguistics medicine composed great work part project towards rebuilding medieval university curriculum include new learning time
alchemy important sciences produce allegorical works topic consider astrology important parts natural philosophy theology contributions advanced alchemy connections soteriology christian theology
bacon writings integrated morality salvation alchemy prolongation life
correspondence clement highlighted noting importance alchemy papacy
like greeks bacon acknowledged division alchemy practical theoretical spheres
noted theoretical lay outside scope aristotle natural philosophers latin writers time
practical however confirmed theoretical thought experiment bacon advocated uses natural science medicine
later european legend however bacon became archmage
particular along albertus magnus credited forging brazen head capable answering owner questions
soon bacon influential work pseudo geber sometimes identified paul taranto appeared
summa perfectionis remained staple summary alchemical practice theory medieval renaissance periods
notable inclusion practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory unusual clarity described
end th century alchemy developed fairly structured system belief
adepts believed macrocosm microcosm theories hermes say believed processes affect minerals substances could effect human body example one could learn secret purifying gold one could use technique purify human soul
believed four elements four qualities described strong tradition cloaking written ideas labyrinth coded jargon set traps mislead uninitiated
finally alchemists practiced art actively experimented chemicals made observations theories universe operated
entire philosophy revolved around belief man soul divided within fall adam
purifying two parts man soul man could reunited god
th century alchemy became accessible europeans outside confines latin speaking churchmen scholars
alchemical discourse shifted scholarly philosophical debate exposed social commentary alchemists
dante piers plowman chaucer painted unflattering pictures alchemists thieves liars
pope john xxii edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade false promises transmutation made pseudo alchemists
henry iv england banned practice multiplying metals although possible buy licence attempt make gold alchemically number granted henry vi edward iv
critiques regulations centered around pseudo alchemical charlatanism actual study alchemy continued increasingly christian tone
th century saw christian imagery death resurrection employed alchemical texts petrus bonus john rupescissa works written name raymond lull arnold villanova
nicolas flamel well known alchemist good example pseudepigraphy practice giving works name someone else usually famous
although historical flamel existed writings legends assigned appeared
flamel religious scholar many predecessors entire interest subject revolved around pursuit philosopher stone
work spends great deal time describing processes reactions never actually gives formula carrying transmutations
work aimed gathering alchemical knowledge existed especially regarded philosopher stone
th th centuries alchemists much like flamel concentrated looking philosophers stone
bernard trevisan george ripley made similar contributions
cryptic allusions symbolism led wide variations interpretation art
renaissance early modern europe page alchemic treatise ramon llull th century red sun rising city final illustration th century alchemical text splendor solis
word rubedo meaning redness adopted alchemists signalled alchemical success end great work
renaissance hermetic platonic foundations restored european alchemy
dawn medical pharmaceutical occult entrepreneurial branches alchemy followed
late th century marsilo ficino translated corpus hermeticum works plato latin
previously unavailable europeans first time full picture alchemical theory bacon declared absent
renaissance humanism renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away physics refocus mankind alchemical vessel
esoteric systems developed blended alchemy broader occult hermeticism fusing magic astrology christian cabala
key figure development german heinrich cornelius agrippa received hermetic education italy schools humanists
de occulta philosophia attempted merge kabbalah hermeticism alchemy
instrumental spreading new blend hermeticism outside borders italy
philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim cast alchemy new form rejecting agrippa occultism moving away chrysopoeia
paracelsus pioneered use chemicals minerals medicine wrote many said alchemy making gold silver
aim consider virtue power may lie medicines
hermetical views sickness health body relied harmony man microcosm nature macrocosm
took approach different using analogy manner soul purification manner humans must certain balances minerals bodies certain illnesses body chemical remedies could cure
paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine plant remedies since named spagyric synonym alchemy greek words meaning separate join together based latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula
iatrochemistry also refers pharmaceutical applications alchemy championed paracelsus
john dee july december followed agrippa occult tradition
although better known angel summoning divination role astrologer cryptographer consultant queen elizabeth dee alchemical monas hieroglyphica written popular influential work
writing portrayed alchemy sort terrestrial astronomy line hermetic axiom
th century short lived supernatural interpretation alchemy became popular including support fellows royal society robert boyle elias ashmole
proponents supernatural interpretation alchemy believed philosopher stone might used summon communicate angels
entrepreneurial opportunities common alchemists renaissance europe
alchemists contracted elite practical purposes related mining medical services production chemicals medicines metals gemstones
rudolf ii holy roman emperor late th century famously received sponsored various alchemists court prague including dee associate edward kelley
king james iv scotland julius duke brunswick lüneburg henry duke brunswick lüneburg augustus elector saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn maurice landgrave hesse kassel contracted alchemists
john son arthur dee worked court physician michael russia charles england also compiled alchemical book fasciculus chemicus
alchemist sendivogius jan matejko although appointments legitimate trend pseudo alchemical fraud continued renaissance
betrüger would use sleight hand claims secret knowledge make money secure patronage
legitimate mystical medical alchemists michael maier heinrich khunrath wrote fraudulent transmutations distinguishing con artists
false alchemists sometimes prosecuted fraud
terms chemia alchemia used synonyms early modern period differences alchemy chemistry small scale assaying metallurgy neat present day
important overlaps practitioners trying classify alchemists chemists craftsmen anachronistic
example tycho brahe alchemist better known astronomical astrological investigations laboratory built uraniborg observatory research institute
michael sendivogius michał sędziwój polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor pioneer chemistry wrote mystical works also credited distilling oxygen lab sometime around
sendivogious taught technique cornelius drebbel applied submarine
isaac newton devoted considerably writing study alchemy see isaac newton occult studies either optics physics
early modern alchemists eminent studies include robert boyle jan baptist van helmont
hermeticism complemented rather precluded practical achievements medicine science
later modern period robert boyle alchemist pictured charles mackay extraordinary popular delusions madness crowds
decline european alchemy brought rise modern science emphasis rigorous quantitative experimentation disdain ancient wisdom
although seeds events planted early th century alchemy still flourished two hundred years fact may reached peak th century
late james price claimed produced powder could transmute mercury silver gold
early modern european alchemy continued exhibit diversity theories practices purposes scholastic anti aristotelian paracelsian anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic plus virtually every combination compromise thereof
robert boyle pioneered scientific method chemical investigations
assumed nothing experiments compiled every piece relevant data
boyle would note place experiment carried wind characteristics position sun moon barometer reading case proved relevant
approach eventually led founding modern chemistry th th centuries based revolutionary discoveries lavoisier john dalton
beginning around rigid distinction began drawn first time alchemy chemistry
alchemy restricted realm gold making leading popular belief alchemists charlatans tradition nothing fraud
order protect developing science modern chemistry negative censure alchemy subjected academic writers th century scientific enlightenment attempted sake survival divorce separate new chemistry old practices alchemy
move mostly successful consequences continued th th st centuries
occult revival early th century alchemy received new attention occult science
esoteric occultist school arose th century held continues hold view substances operations mentioned alchemical literature interpreted spiritual sense downplays role alchemy practical tradition protoscience
interpretation forwarded view alchemy art primarily concerned spiritual enlightenment illumination opposed physical manipulation apparatus chemicals claims obscure language alchemical texts allegorical guise spiritual moral mystical processes
th century revival alchemy two seminal figures mary anne atwood ethan allen hitchcock independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy
forwarded completely esoteric view alchemy atwood claimed modern art chemistry notwithstanding surreptitious claims thing common alchemy
atwood work influenced subsequent authors occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite rudolf steiner
hitchcock remarks upon alchymists attempted make case spiritual interpretation claim alchemists wrote spiritual discipline materialistic guise order avoid accusations blasphemy church state
baron carl reichenbach published studies odic force concept similarities alchemy research enter mainstream scientific discussion
